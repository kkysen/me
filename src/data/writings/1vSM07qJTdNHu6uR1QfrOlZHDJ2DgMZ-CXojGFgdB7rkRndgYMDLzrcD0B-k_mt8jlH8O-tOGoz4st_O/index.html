As a Stuyvesant alumnus, that statistic is horrifying and yet all too familiar. Stuyvesant’s student body is only 1% black and 3% Hispanic, compared to 74% Asian-American and 12% white. The situation is worst at Stuy, but the other NYC specialized high schools whose admission is determined solely by performance on the SHSAT, the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, are not much better: &lt; 10% of admissions went to black and Hispanic students, even though 70% of the city’s public school students are black or Hispanic. And despite increasing efforts to reduce the racial disparity, the situation has only grown worse over time (Shapiro). Most agree that the sheer paucity of black and Hispanic students at Stuy and the other specialized high schools is unacceptable, but the fight rages on over what the cause of it is and how we can best solve this crisis.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>It wasn’t always this way, though. During the 1970s and 80s, we had nearly solved the diversity problem. In 1976, the percentage of black and Hispanic students at Stuy reached an all-time high of 12% and maintained that level for the next decade and a </span><span>half</span><span class="c2">. By 1989, Brooklyn Tech had reached an astounding 51% black and Hispanic student body. But then something changed, and these peak levels began plummeting, reaching their all-time lows of 4% at Stuy today (Ali, Chin).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2">If we were able to achieve this in the past, nearly achieving racial diversity in the specialized high schools reflective of the entire public school system, surely we should be able to do it again. If anything, it should be easier now, since racism was more pronounced back then. The question, then, is what happened to precipitate such a drastic reversal? And in reversing it, is there hope that we may be able to start fixing the problem again?</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>But before we can fully understand what changed in the past, we must first understand the leading plan to fix the racial disparity today. </span><span>Proponents of this plan, </span><span>le</span><span>d</span><span> by Mayor Bill de Blasio, allege that the SHSAT is clearly racially discriminatory because of its disparate racial impact. Their plan is simple but radical: completely abolish the SHSAT</span><span> and replace it with entrance</span><span class="c2"> based on a combination of middle school grades and performance on state tests. Doing so would raise the percentage of black and Hispanic students at Stuy to around 45%, fixing the extreme racial stratification and finally achieving racial diversity representative of the entire city (Shapiro; NYT Editorial Board).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>This radical </span><span>new</span><span> plan has sparked outrage, especially in Asian-American and alumni communities, where many believe that the SHSAT is an unbiased test that levels the playing field, and that it is, in fact, the most possibly unbiased, meritocratic option there is, devoid of any of the corruption just exposed in </span><span>the college admissions scandal showing how holistic admissions can be easily corrupted (Shapiro; Friedman). </span><span>As </span><span>former co-editor of </span><span class="c1">The Stuyvesant Spectator</span><span class="c2"> Sonia Epstein argues, it’s clear that the extreme and worsening racial stratification of the specialized high schools is wrong, but the SHSAT is only exposing the symptom of a larger disease, that the city’s education is failing black and Hispanic students at every step of the way.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2">However, the sides are not that clear cut. Even Epstein’s co-editor, Danielle Eisenman, an Asian-American herself, is in favor of nixing the SHSAT. She argues that having so much depend on a single exam is unfair on its own right. Putting aside issues of race, what happens to someone who was just sick on the test day, or is a dyslexic genius who performs badly on standardized tests? Most colleges and many other elite high schools use holistic admissions to create a more representative student body while remaining elite, and the state universities of California and Texas even use the percent rule that de Blasio is proposing. Eisenman, as well as many of those against the SHSAT, concede that there are worse underlying problems creating the racial stratification, but argue that scrapping the SHSAT is a feasible and immediate course of action to begin fixing the larger problem.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>As Eisenman explains, the primary problem of the SHSAT is that it perpetuates privilege. Many poor black and Hispanic students don’t even know about the SHSAT or have inadequate resources to prepare for the exam. But others receive extensive, expensive test prep that gives them a massive advantage on the test. However, as Epstein counters, Stuy’s student body is still extremely economically diverse, with 44% receiving free or reduced lunch, and Asian-Americans remain the city’s poorest ethnic group. Even without money to pay for expensive test prep, Asian-Americans are still able to perform exceedingly well on the SHSAT</span><span>.</span><span> Many of my classmates at Stuy struggled financially, working on weekends and evenings, some with parents working multiple jobs, all while still managing the heavy Stuy workload. Thus, according to author Daniel Friedman in </span><span class="c1">Quillette</span><span class="c2">, the SHSAT is demonstrably not socioeconomically discriminatory, and actually serves as a major driver of socioeconomic mobility, catapulting the city’s poorest to elite colleges, professional jobs, and the middle class. It rewards students who put in the effort to tirelessly study and prove their merit regardless of their socioeconomic status.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>Instead of the SHSAT perpetuating privilege, the real problem, as Jiaying Fan and many others argue, is </span><span>that many Asian (and immigrant) cultures prioritize education, and thus even the poorest of Asian families are willing to spend scarce time and money on test prep to invest in their children’s education</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span class="c2">The waitress at my neighborhood Japanese restaurant has been saving all of her tips to pay for tutoring for her son, who just recently was admitted to Stuy after years of preparation. In fact, “Asian households spend about 15% of their income on supplemental education services, compared to a mere 2% spent by their American counterparts” (Anderson). On the other hand, some other cultures don’t value education as highly, leading to less general awareness and less time and money spent on preparing for the SHSAT, and many believe this is a primary cause of the racial disparities seen in the SHSAT (Fan).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>To scrap the SHSAT would thus be to punish meritocracy. As Epstein and Friedman explain, it would punish students who have devoted so much effort to studying, thereby making the system actually more biased, while also admitting students who aren’t fully prepared for the rigor to survive in such an advanced environment (in 80 NYC middle </span><span>schools</span><span>, less than 7% of students </span><span>even</span><span> passed the state exams (Weinstein)). This would then require Stuyvesant to lower its academic </span><span>standards</span><span> to accommodate less prepared students instead of </span><span>just turning all of these students into </span><span>smarter</span><span> students.</span><span> As most Stuy students soon realize, including Epstein and I, Stuy is so </span><span>special</span><span> precisely </span><span>because</span><span class="c2"> of its special students, not only its teachers or other resources. Students don’t go to Stuy to become special, they are admitted because they are special. They thrive because every student teaches one another and pushes each other to strive higher. For example, the struggling waitress’ child will bring a unique perspective to his classmates precisely because of his struggle to get into the school while still maintaining Stuy’s academic rigor. Thus, to allow students in without the rigor to survive would make Stuy no longer special, and even with just the SHSAT, we are already very diverse in our specialization.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>As an Asian-American and a graduate from Stuy last year, this issue really resonates with me, because I am deeply grateful for the challenging, rigorous, and immensely rewarding time I had at Stuy. So the day after news of de Blasio’s plan came out last June, every student at Stuy was in </span><span>heated</span><span> debate about how to solve the unacceptable racial disparities without losing what makes Stuy so special, with comments ranging from “We worked our asses off to get in here and now they’re going to change the standards!” to “Say goodbye to our Quantum Mechanics class that we lobbied so hard for—now it’s going to have to make room for more Algebra I classes.” I knew the status quo couldn’t justifiably be maintained, but I was at a loss as to what could possibly be done. Yet I also knew that lowering Stuy’s standards wouldn’t help anyone; it wouldn’t address the severe underlying problems in our education system, and it would cause Stuy to lose what makes it a specialized high school, and thus lose its potent socioeconomic catapulting power in the process, which is precisely what makes it so </span><span>valuable</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>One of the major problems with this controversy over the SHSAT is that it is pitting minorities against each other. Richard Carranza, NYC’s Schools Chancellor, said that “I just don’t buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools” (qtd. in Weinstein). In doing so, he’s pitting Asian-Americans against blacks and Hispanics, minority against minority, in a fight we can’t afford to have.</span><span> It would be much better, then, to find a solution that avoids inflaming this conflict, one that doesn’t only help black and Hispanic students at the expense of anyone else, one that avoids completely dismantling the SHSAT, and one that helps far more than just the few students that are accepted into a specialized high school.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>This is where the history of the SHSAT comes into play. Mayor de Blasio and company have pinpointed the SHSAT as the source of racial stratification. But the SHSAT is the one thing that remained constant </span><span>all this time</span><span class="c2">, so it couldn’t have been the SHSAT that caused the precipitous decline in racial diversity. In trying to reverse what did cause the rapid decline, we can then avoid much of the racial politics involved in the SHSAT itself. We can avoid pitting minority against minority and instead fix the underlying, broader problem.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>In sociology professors Syed Ali and Margaret Chin’s statistically and historically thorough article in </span><span class="c1">The Atlantic</span><span class="c2">, I discovered that, in the 1990s, right as racial diversity in the specialized high schools peaked, then-Mayor Giuliani ended the gifted and talented (G&amp;T) programs that were widespread throughout the middle schools, cutting the NYC DOE’s budget by two billion dollars. Soon afterward, the percentage of black and Hispanic students at Stuy and the other specialized high schools began to plummet. In an effort to eliminate such ability tracking, the G&amp;T programs, because they were deemed discriminatory and stratifying, the city unwittingly spelled the doom of racial diversity at its most elite public institutions (Boryga; Friedman; Ali, Chin).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2">The G&amp;T programs, a part of each middle school (rather than a few citywide or separate schools like now) served as mini-specialized high schools preparing students for the SHSAT and bridging the gap between elementary and high schools. It gave students, even in the poorest, most crime-ridden neighborhoods, the chance to study alongside other exceptional students. It used the same principle that the specialized high schools use today: that, if you put a bunch of smart kids together in the same room, wonderful things happen (Friedman; Ali, Chin).</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2">However, the G&amp;T programs were also often a path to more privilege for the already privileged. How students were identified as gifted, especially at such young ages, wasn’t always the most egalitarian, and gifted tracks often ended up falling on racial and socioeconomic lines. In the words of Deborah Meier, the founder of several public high schools in East Harlem in the 1990s, “Are we saying gifted children are more valuable to society”, especially when how they are chosen may not be the most accurate? “A society which picks out some children as more valuable than others is sending a terrible message. Any time people talk about what the gifted need - problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, creative thinking - they’re describing what every child needs. In fact, other children may need it even more” (qtd. in Stone). It was this rhetoric, that gifted children shouldn’t receive preferential treatment, and that underperforming children need that help even more, that spearheaded the detracking movement of the 1990s.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>This rhetoric continued into the 2000s, leading to the passage of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001, which federally cemented </span><span>this</span><span> emphasis on the underperforming because they need more help. But instead of removing the inequality believed to be created through tracking, in following the NCLB, the NYC DOE is not treating students at each school the same, but teaching them to the same level so that they have equal educational outcomes. They are stamping out all specialization, only </span><span>to then expect students to suddenly  </span><span>specialize in high school. </span><span>Instead of ending up with each middle school being diverse, having both honors and remedial tracks, you end up with middle schools that are drastically different from each other, but each of which is very homogeneous within.</span><span class="c2"> It’s as if the good middle schools are specialized high schools, except you can’t get in through a meritocratic test, but by what neighborhood you live in. Thus, the lack of tracking is perpetuating geographic stratification, punishing the exceptional students at poorly performing schools and preventing them from having the resources to study for and ace the SHSAT.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>However, even as the detriments of tracking are laid bare today in our current public school system, there continues to be a vehement backlash against tracking to this day, a backlash that is still founded in fears that tracking perpetuates privilege</span><span>. </span><span class="c2">Attending elementary school in staunchly liberal Park Slope, I saw this first hand. No parent wanted any child to be differentiated from any other. We were all “winners” in everything we did. While that may have helped build confidence, it certainly didn’t help me and a few peers who were bored out of our minds in math class year after year because the school refused to accept that some kids were simply at a different level than others.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2">Much of this argument relies on the results of the international assessment PISA, which is given to 15-year-olds across the world and used to find quantitative patterns in education for shaping future policy. It conclusively found that ability tracking does not improve overall performance and leads to greater differences in student performances, including stratifying performance both racially and socioeconomically (OECD). This is extremely compelling evidence, and yet it goes against the clear results seen in NYC that the elimination of tracking led to a significant increase in racial stratification. Maybe detracking isn’t the culprit—it’s hard to argue against the extensive data, and there were countless other changes to the NYC public school system since then. But in looking more closely at PISA’s results and the rhetoric exemplified by Meier, some serious shortcomings as pertaining to the NYC public school system become clear.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span class="c2">Going back to Meier’s argument, while tracking may have given the “gifted” preferential treatment, the absence of tracking also hurts these gifted students, because while the troubled students receive extra help in compensation, the gifted students need no such help and are thus taught less and never given any challenges. Thus, instead of creating true equality, eliminating tracking only tries to create equity, i.e. equal outcomes. It is this notion of equity, not equality, that PISA measures.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>However, it cannot be expected that everyone will have the same educational outcome because everyone is different. By focusing on equity, we only focus on the underperforming students to help them become closer to the average while leaving the top students without challenges, causing them to regress to the mean. In doing so, we realize the goal of equity: to make everyone migrate to the average so that we all become the same, equal. But the more we champion equity, equality of outcome, the more we lose equality of opportunity, which is certainly not desirable. Thus, instead of equity in education, we need diversity of educational outcomes. We need to help the underperforming students, but not by abandoning the top students. We need true equality of opportunity, which means teaching </span><span>everyone</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>Furthermore, the international body of students PISA tested seems to poorly represent the NYC public school system (which makes sense—it’s an international study that can’t account for local differences). Like most anti-tracking arguments, PISA makes an assumption that is grossly untrue in most NYC schools: that they are heterogeneous. </span><span>Schools are geographically </span><span>zoned</span><span> in NYC, so predominantly poor, black neighborhoods will have schools that </span><span>are</span><span> predominantly poor and black as well, for example.</span><span> This is actually a part of the larger structural issue of educational inequality, but while it still exists, this homogeneity of schools renders PISA’s results mostly invalid, since in a NYC middle school that is already predominantly black, tracking within that school cannot be racially stratifying, since the entire school is already racially homogeneous. </span><span>The fear of tracking, of privilege perpetuating inequality, is thus rendered null in most cases, </span><span>since</span><span> in a racially and socioeconomically homogeneous school, there is little privilege to begin with.</span><span class="c2"> But by identifying the few gifted students, putting them in the same classroom, and teaching them just as much as the most troubled students, they might be able to overcome the odds to gain admission to Stuy.</span></p><p class="c3 c4"><span>With this in mind, middle school tracking in NYC is still very much viable and advantageous. Although tracking has clear detriments evident around the world, we cannot ignore the massive correlation and plausible causation between middle school tracking and diversity in specialized high schools. Because of its zoning and segregated demographics, t</span><span>he</span><span> nature of the NYC public school system is much more conducive to tracking as a means of combating exactly what its elimination was meant to prevent: systemic racial and socioeconomic stratification. </span><span>It is precisely because NYC is already so racially stratified geographically that tracking can be used to fight against the stratification, since it better levels the playing field between drastically different schools and gradually prepares students for the specialization that only increases during high school, college, and life in general.</span><span> We have founded human civilization upon the specialization of labor, taking advantage of our immense diversity in all things. Thus, we need to gradually introduce specialization to children through tracking, allowing each student to reach their own maximum potential instead of pushing everyone to be the same. So even though tracking may not be the most </span><span>equitable solution, we are aiming to achieve natural diversity through equality</span><span>. </span><span>If we can </span><span>re-implement tracking </span><span>in NYC, taking care to ensure it is flexible, narrowly-tailored to specific subjects, and not introduced too early, we may be able to begin solving the extreme racial stratification in the specialized high schools in a constructive, non-racially divisive way that preserves what makes them so special. </span><span>And at the same time, we will be</span><span> offering a lifeline to the thousands of other exceptional students we routinely ignore and fail that don’t have the privilege of attending a school like </span><span>Stuy</span><span>. </span><span class="c2">With this in mind, I can envision a day in the near future when the bridge into Stuy’s building on Chambers Street is filled with a rainbow of highly qualified students all eager to get to class like I was every morning.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">Works
