I learned about the early persecution of Christians in the pagan Roman Empire of antiquity and the Babylonian captivity of Jews, orchestrated at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar; I learned about the Reconquista to expel Muslims from the Iberian Peninsula; and I learned about the rising tensions and hostilities between Judaism and Islam, and Islam and Hinduism in Israel and Palestine, and Pakistan and India, respectively, as well as the intra-religion conflict of sectarianism, such as the ceaseless feud between Sunnis and Shi’ites in Iraq and Iran.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Through all these horrendous acts of killing in the me of religion, I came to acknowledge the tremendous influence religion has on war, while simultaneously wondering why on Earth would anyone ever do such a thing.  To me, these religious “holy” wars seemed to serve no purpose, accomplishing nothing at the expense of millions of lives.  People killed those of opposing religions, while also sacrificing themselves in the me of their religion, and even if one argued that these holy wars served to protect the religious community as a whole, it is immediately disproved by the rampant sectarianism in most religions that causes just as much or sometimes even greater conflict and subsequent strife.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Being a hyper-rational, logic-driven person who has embraced science and the faith in quantum mechanics rather than a supernatural being, I began to question how </span><span class="c1">religion</span><span class="c2 c1"> seemingly hinders the growth and change of human society.  A central part of most religions is conservatism, and preserving what has been traditional in the past, having supposedly already found the answer to how to live life, and particularly important has been the marginalization of the inherently liberal sciences.  Therefore, religion no longer entailing advantageous change seemingly contradicts evolution and natural selection.  Change, or mutations, and its adaptive qualities are the key to evolution, because they allow for the differentiation and progression of the species as a whole.  Therefore, in the case of humans, change would help advance human society, evident by the exponential growth over the last few centuries ever since science began to break free of the constraints of religion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Yet religion has remained a pervasive and fundamental aspect of human society from Paleolithic times to the present day; therefore, it seems as if religion must then confer some sort of evolutionary advantage in order to not only survive but also prosper throughout the majority of human history.  But could it instead be that religion, specifically the belief in a higher being, has been completely detrimental to the gamut of human society, and has only survived due to linkage to other, more beneficial, qualities?  Perhaps religion is only a stepping stone in the Darwinian evolution of humanity, helping the more primitive societies of the past coalesce and unify in order to facilitate societal survival, but serving as a hindrance to humanity’s evolution in today’s more global, technological, and scientifically aware world.  This raises the fundamental question: is the belief in a higher being an evolutionary advantage or disadvantage, and if it is an advantage, is it unique in its role to humanity, or can it be replaced?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I embarked on my exploration with an extensive literature search, trying to search for theories that explored in detail the numerous advantages and disadvantages of religion.  These </span><span class="c1">advantages and disadvantages </span><span class="c1">have been radically altered in the face of an evolving human society that began with isolated tribes of hunter-gatherers, progressed to pockets of semi-isolated, heterogeneous city-states that arose around the major river valley civilizations after the advent of agriculture, then partially homogeneous civilizations that interacted across the globe, and finally to today’s current interconnected, globalized society that consists of somewhat stable nation-states in which nationalism, cultural identity, and </span><span class="c1">economy</span><span class="c2 c1"> necessities repeatedly take precedence over religion.  My first major find was an article on the evolution of religion by Barbara J. King that referenced a scholarly paper by Bernard Crespi and Kyle Summers.  Through reading that article and the referenced paper, I stumbled upon inclusive fitness theory and kin selection theory.  Originally hypothesized in 1964 by W.D. Hamilton, the idea of inclusive fitness is that evolution is not only survival of the fittest, but rather it is the survival of genes.  It had been long thought that the evolutionary aim of each organism was to survive and reproduce in order to spread its genes the farthest, but the inclusive fitness theory argues that spreading your genes can also be accomplished through increasing the chances of survival and reproduction of your relatives and offspring, for there is a whole plethora of identical genes shared among such a genetically close group, and thus by helping your kin, you are helping the same genes that are also in you propagate throughout the human population.  In other words, by helping those related to you, you are spreading many of the same genes that exist in you, because they also exist in your relatives.  This subsequently leads to kin selection theory, which is arguing that we humans evolutionarily select for our kin; by facilitating their survival and reproductive success, we are selecting them, as in natural selection, to propagate their genes, because it is also beneficial to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In Crespi and Summer’s paper, they hypothesize that the origins of religion are tied to </span><span class="c1">using religion as a means of promoting inclusive fitness and subsequently kin selection</span><span class="c1">.  By creating a religious community that probably originated as an extended family, serving the gods becomes equivalent to serving the interests of your kin.  Therefore, religion becomes a method of creating a highly united community that promotes altruism through religion, </span><span class="c1">and thus encouraging us to help others, </span><span class="c1">which is a crucial concept in inclusive fitness.  I was encouraged by this find; I now had a basis from which I could continue my literature search</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2 c1">where I could proceed by trying to identify, and secure interviews with, a series of experts framing this topic.  I quickly learned that this is not a well-studied issue and there does not appear to be anyone who could be considered an expert in all facets of the topic.  Hence, I decided to speak to people who would approach this topic from varying points of view: religious studies, religion itself and theology, evolutionary biology, and evolutionary psychology of religion in an effort to compile a fuller perspective on my question compared to one I could get from just one person with a strong opinion.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I immediately emailed Barbara King, Bernard Crespi, and Kyle Summers, all people who were referenced in or wrote the aforementioned article, beseeching them to allow me a few minutes to conduct an interview.  I received replies from all three of them fairly quickly, within a day or two, but Barbara King declined due to a family emergency, Bernard Crespi said he would love to but that he was away for another week, and </span><span class="c1">yet</span><span class="c1"> in Kyle Summers I found a potential gold mine after he replied, “</span><span class="c2 c1">Sure, I can talk to you about this, although I should stipulate that the study of religion from an evolutionary perspective is a not a major focus for me (actually I mainly work on the evolution, ecology and behavior of poison frogs in Central and South America).”  I found it hilarious that he should “stipulate” that he actually studies “poison frogs in Central and South America,” yet I knew that he would still know a great deal about my topic, having co-written the aforementioned paper.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few follow-up emails, we arranged for me to call him (unfortunately, he teaches at North Carolina University) Sunday evening.  Beginning the interview, I was bubbling with excitement at all the fascinating answers and opinions I envisioned would flow from the mind of Professor Summers, but as I made my way through my long list of questions, my excitement began to gradually wane; he kept referring back to his paper and the theory of inclusive fitness and how it describes so many societal models, all the while</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c1">giving long-winded answers to all my questions.  Sometimes I was looking for a straightforward answer that required him to state his main opinion, but he kept avoiding these, including extra information in his answers that was somewhat redundant, or sometimes talking about the history of the theories that explained them.  </span><span class="c1">I wasn’t able to get through even half of my questions, as his long answers combined by my many follow-up questions stretched the interview to over half-an-hour.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">One very fascinating thing he explained about the external forces acting upon the evolution of such religious groups was that in times of peace and prosperity, religious groups tended to diverge and differentiate, creating different sects within what had once been a single, homogenous religion.  Yet in times of war, or when some external conflict put considerable pressure on their survival and the continuance of their religion, the previously bifurcating sects were reunified under a common threat.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This idea reminded me of a book I have been reading in biology class: </span><span class="c1 c6">Undeniable</span><span class="c1"> by Bill Nye “the Science Guy.”  In one chapter he explained the concept of punctuated equilibrium in the context of evolution.  Rather than species tending to slowly evolve as one homogenous population, species tended to diverge into differentiating populations over time.  As one interdependent population, species evolved at a snail’s pace, but when a small population became isolated from the rest of the species, its speed of evolution was increased hundredfold.  When a more adapted, more fit organism emerged from this isolated population and natural selective pressures intensified for a period, </span><span class="c1">this</span><span class="c1"> more adapted organism would be able to outcompete its former species, </span><span class="c1">thus </span><span class="c2 c1">allowing it to proliferate in its place, creating a whole new population that constituted a new species.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This expedited evolution in small, isolated populations is due to the fact that random mutations in some organisms represented a larger percentage of the entire population, thus allowing it to be spread throughout that population faster; following these lines, a single mutant could more easily outcompete a smaller population than a large one</span><span class="c1">,</span><span class="c1 c2"> thereby expediting the mutation’s proliferation throughout that smaller population.  In a larger population, such a small mutation that could lead to a population-wide adaptation was marginalized, because selective pressures would not be able to confer a large enough advantage to the newly adapted organism for it to proliferate throughout and thus affect the entire population.  Therefore, species evolved not at a single, constant rate, but rather in intercalated, short periods of accelerated evolution and then longer periods of stasis, the latter during which the species experienced prosperity and an unchanging, large population.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Therefore, I saw a major discrepancy between this theory of punctuated equilibrium explained by Kyle Summers’s idea and Bill Nye.  As Summers explained it, although religions did tend to diverge and differentiate during times of peace and prosperity, when the selective pressure was introduced to the entire religion, instead of it allowing the more adapted group to outcompete the other sect,</span><span class="c1"> in which case it would allow</span><span class="c2 c1"> it an opening to proliferate in its place, the many diverging religious sects would unite and thus negate their “speciation” as the more adapted groups would fight to preserve the lives of the less able, thereby negating the effects of natural selection and halting the evolutionary process at work.  Consequently, I began to question more how the altruistic ideals that religion inspired in people in order to help the group survive, as explained by the inclusive fitness theory, backfired when it was confronted with attempts of “speciation” within the religion, and evolution of the society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Unfortunately, by the time I had read about that theory in </span><span class="c1 c6">Undeniable</span><span class="c2 c1">, my interview with Summers had long since passed.  Therefore, combined with wanting to learn more about other complex questions I still had to ask him, such as “Is religion on a path to be replaced by something that can replicate the effects of kin selection in a way more advantageous in today’s world?” in addition to a growing desire to question him about the discrepancy between his idea and punctuated equilibrium, I decided that I would schedule another interview with Summers.  After all, he had to cut the interview short, as he had had some other business to attend to, and had said that I was welcome to talk to him again.  Incidentally, my recording of that interview had accidentally been deleted, meaning that another interview with him, one from which I could draw some great quotes, would be of great help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Meanwhile, I had also scheduled a phone interview with a graduate student currently getting a PhD in religious studies at Princeton.  This graduate student is actually my little brother’s friend’s much older sister by about twenty years, named Elena Dugan.  After exchanging a few emails, I could already see that she would be much more original and open to my inquiries than Summers had been; after all, to quote her, “I’m not too far gone from my own days asking for interviews :).”  When the time for my scheduled phone call with her arrived, my anxiety was no longer much of a problem, compared to my bumbling, stuttering self when I was talking to Summers, for the jitters of my first interview had passed and Elena seemed like a much more accessible person.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After reminding her of the intricacies of inclusive fitness theory, I asked her if she could see any major flaws in this way of interpreting religion.  She brought up a very valid point in how many eastern religions, namely Buddhism, are not associated with an omnipotent god; it is the goal of each individual to attain nirvana, or enlightenment, and the path to achieving this goal comes from within oneself, </span><span class="c1">therefore having less </span><span class="c2 c1">of a communal effect compared to the Abrahamic religions, for example.  We then went on to discuss the danger to be so inclusive in our definition of religion, yet still set Christianity as our archetypal religion and base our assumption of other religions, which can be drastically different in some cases, upon our perception of Christianity.  As I continued to talk with her, I came to greatly appreciate how friendly and loquacious she was, willing to elaborate, take a definitive stance, and really fully explain her profound thoughts, especially after my disappointing interview with Summers, prompting me to realize that this was indeed a much more rewarding interview.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Near the end of the interview, about twenty-five minutes in, I was asking her about whether or not she thought that in today’s modernizing world, if religion would ever be replaced by a less spiritual, more concrete equivalent.  Her response was that she thought that religion’s far-reaching effects and influence has been diminishing in the modern age, but there still remained a defining element at the heart of religion that was entirely unique and irreplaceable.  However, she was willing to admit that many parts of religion had begun to be replaced by modern-day equivalents.  Non-governmental, or non-profit, organizations (NGOs), she argued, were a substitute for the altruism that had long since been dominated by religious motivation.  Similarly, she said that nationalism was an emergent concept that, as it began to grow in influence, managed to triumph over religion in terms of its compellence of the populace to fight for something greater than them, which engendered a transition from willing to die in the me of God to sacrificing oneself for the nation-state.  However, she still stipulated that the root of such altruism often remains religion, and altruistic motivators such as nationalism can only begin to supercede religion when “your death means less than something else.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having just conducted such a successful interview, I now turned back to Summers.  I had already talked to him, so I was now ready to be more confrontational in my interview, and pushing harder for more detailed, concrete answers.   Yet I still never managed to get him to give me a definitive answer to my question.  Similarly to last time I had talked to him, he continued to skirt around and outright avoid answering my questions.  He would often agree with me in a very drawn out way, saying things like, </span><span class="c1">“Yeah, ahhh, well, uhhh, it’s hard to say.  Yeah, you mean, I know, yeah it’s hard to say, ummm.  So it is certainly true that, ummm, in many cases people may be more wary, of, of, ummm, being exploited by religious leaders, which may, ummm, make it more difficult to sort of, use, use one’s position in religious hierarchy to increase inclusive fitness.”</span><span class="c1">  This answer was in response to this question: “The role of religion in kin selection seems to be very important in the past when we understood less about the world and were a much less connected, globalized society, but does it still play that role in modern society?” so it is clearly evident that Summers only made a minor jump to his conclusion that the power associated with an exalted position within a religious hierarchy could be diminished in today’s world due to the wariness of the ordinary, rank and file people.  He then referred back to inclusive fitness, but he didn’t explain in what way they were connected, or elaborate on the multitude of other differences between religion’s role today and in the past, and when I tried to probe more into this topic, he continued to shut me down.  I left feeling disappointed in the lack of information I could extract from him, desperately hoping that his colleague, Bernard Crespi, would be able to provide me with some more concrete and elaborate information.  It hadn’t been a complete dead end, and I felt like Summers actually knew a lot more, he was just inadequate at articulating his thoughts and expressing them clearly, so I wasn’t able to tap into that wealth of knowledge; thus, both of the two interviews with him </span><span class="c1">proved unable to meet their potenti</span><span class="c1">al</span><span class="c2 c1">s.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I began my interview with Professor Crespi by asking him the same questions as I had asked Summers, since they had both collaborated on the paper I had read, but the answers I received from them were vastly different.  I was relieved that Crespi wasn’t vague and avoidant, as Summers had been, yet I was still disappointed that I wasn’t able to receive a definitive answer to my quest.  When I began by asking him what he </span><span class="c1">though</span><span class="c1">t the evolutionary advantages of religion are, he interrupted, saying, “One question I would have to ask you about your question would be advantages for who or what...because you have to think about groups of religious people, but you have to think about individuals as well, and then you also have to kind of think about are you talking about religion such as you have in hunter-gatherer sorts of people or religion in the context of big, recent religions.”  Responding that I was asking about multiple scenarios, one for hunter-gatherer type, small, primitive religions, one for semi-modern, global religions, one for the survival of the human species as a whole, and one for the propagation of particular genes, he began talking about how different religions play disparate roles in conferring evolutionary advantages.  For example, he cited </span><span class="c1">celibate religions like the Shakers, who do not believe in reproducing at all, on one end of the scale, and Catholicism and Hasidic Judaism, who believe in propagating many children, on the other end.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I recognized how much this statement affected my search, because in the modern world, where selection pressures are invariably weaker, religions can afford to reproduce less, and thus the evolutionary advantages of such religions exists on a huge scale, with some having no advantages whatsoever</span><span class="c1">,</span><span class="c2 c1"> as in the case of the Shakers, and others still having varying degrees of evolutionary advantages.  However, the Shaker religion is so extreme that it cannot possibly survive for long, because the only way to have new members is through converts, and a life of celibacy living on a farm in Maine is not very appealing. The fact that there are only three Shakers left attests to this; additionally, the fact that all it took to steal the formerly fourth Shaker away from a religion with no future was a female reporter to come interview them so that one man could get romantically involved with the reporter and leave his religion behind (Grondahl).  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">When reading, or at least attempting to read, Crespi and Summers’s paper on the inclusive fitness theory for religion, I saw a chart detailing the results of an experiment Crespi conducted.  I saw that he was testing the effects of different mutations on hormone receptors, and how the range of such differences correlated with religiosity, measured by the subjects.  He tested receptors for hormones such as oxytocin, the so-called “love” hormone that is involved in developing social bonds, and arginine vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (Crespi and Summers 313-323), the latter of which I’m not sure of its relation to religiosity, because to my knowledge, it only controls diuresis.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After learning from Crespi that he mostly approached this subject of the religious evolution from a genetic and molecular viewpoint, I asked him to more clearly explain his experiment to me; in response, he said that it was quite simple.  First, they measured different mutations the subjects had in their production of the hormone receptors by measuring their single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to assay their polygenicity, or in other words, to find where on the spectrum of the amount of hormone receptor they laid.  Then they gave them a simple questionnaire that measured their religiosity, thus allowing them to correlate it with where on the aforementioned spectrum they laid.  However, when I asked him </span><span class="c1">if</span><span class="c1"> he obtained any conclusive results, </span><span class="c1">he stipulated that he had just started doing this research, and that this type of researching, the genetics behind religiosity, is novel, and there has not been enough time to gather sufficient data to jump to any conclusions.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Still very interested in this surprising new angle to my search, I pressed on, asking if such methods of using DNA sequencing to measure religiosity could be used for ancient skeletons whose DNA has been preserved.  I was hoping that if the correlation between particular SNPs and religiosity were determined, then it might allow us to work backwards, determining the religiosity of a person based on the SNPs present in his/her DNA.  If that were possible, I thought it might be conceivable to sequence the DNA of deceased bodies, and then attempt to map the evolution of religiosity in the history of the human species (and perhaps even other hominids, too) using genetics, mirroring the way most evolution is studied through the anatomical differences in skeletons.  However, Crespi immediately said that this would never be possible, because the sample size would be extremely low, and thus there would be no statistical significance in the results obtained. </span><span class="c1">Yet I wasn’t convinced, because if what he said was completely true, then the anatomical differences seen in skeletons should be completely disregarded as well, because all skeletons represent a tiny portion of their species/population.  Instead major hypotheses and theories have been derived from such skeletal discoveries, and therefore, perhaps the same could be true for ancient religiosity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">While reflecting on how I happened to chance upon the theory of punctuated equilibrium in a book I had to read for biology, which was surprisingly relevant to some major aspects of my search, I realized that there was also a major connection between punctuated equilibrium and the two major theories that explain the advancement of human civilizations, posited by the famous historians Arnold Toynbee and William McNeill.</span><span class="c1">  Arnold Toynbee hypothesized that the advancement of human civilization can be explained solely by civilizations successfully overcoming challenges, while William McNeill hypothesized that this phenomenon of the gradual amelioration of human civilization is caused by the interactions between different human societies and the dissemination of the resulting information.  </span><span class="c1">I began to think of these two competing theories in the context of all species, not just limited to human civilization.  Therefore, I associated Toynbee’s theory of overcoming challenges with the punctuated, short periods of fast-forwarded evolution, linking the rapid surmounting of a challenge with expedited evolution.  Likewise, I correlated McNeill’s theory of interaction with the long, inter-evolutionary periods, connecting humanity’s gradual amelioration through interaction with the slow but sure increase in genetic variation of the long periods of equilibrium, in which evolution may happen, but always happens at a slow and steady rate.</span><span class="c2 c1">  Through this analogy, I thought that the astounding growth of humanity throughout its relatively short yet revolutionary history, which had previously been explained by Toynbee and McNeill’s competing theories, as a combination of the two as per punctuated equilibrium, and thus human history can simply be seen as intercalated periods of gradual growth and advancement followed by accelerated periods of societal evolution.  Likewise, the reverse analogy can be used to explain evolution in a more historical, human-oriented way.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">What I found particularly fascinating in this remarkable connection is that because religion has been forever intertwined with the course of human history, my above connection between punctuated equilibrium and the theories of Toynbee and McNeill can also apply to the evolution of religion, as it so closely linked to the birth of human civilization and subsequent rampant, yet-to-cease growth to the state in which we exist today.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As I began to reflect on this extensive search, my mind wandered to what explained the genetic separateness of the Ashkenazi Jews and </span><span class="c1">how endogamy</span><span class="c1"> is encouraged by Orthodox Jews.  I have long since known that such behavior of in breeding severely limits the gene pool, and thus acts on genetic variation within a population similarly to incest, just not quite as severe.  Because the gene pool is so small, genetic diseases and other maladaptations become pronounced</span><span class="c1">, </span><span class="c2 c1">thus spreading easily throughout the entire population.  This is the case with Ashkenazi Jews, and it is clearly evident in their rates of genetic diseases compared to the rest of the human population.  Therefore, I had always thought that such religious behavior was extremely detrimental to Judaism and severely harmed their chances of survival, which only is multiplied when considering their inclusive fitness because they often marry within the religion.  In this instance, I thought that it was clear that religion proved to be a major evolutionary disadvantage, but after hearing about Summers’s theory about the behavior of religious groups when they come under pressure, that different sects that would otherwise be feuding unify under a common threat, in addition to reading about the theory of punctuated equilibrium and the two theories’ glaring discrepancies, I wondered if such thinking could be applied to Jewish sexual selection.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Perhaps by marrying within the religion, such sects of Judaism are promoting genetic seclusion and isolation and thereby stimulating speciation.  If this is the case, then Judaism is more closely following punctuated equilibrium than Summers’s theory, because it is genetically cordoning itself off from the rest of the human gene pool, and under times of stress, does not re-merge with the rest of humanity, but rather stays within itself, all the while promoting speciation.  Following the prediction of punctuated equilibrium, then it should be observed within the Jewish population that not only is there a greater occurrence of genetic diseases, but also a greater occurrence of genetic adaptations.  Therefore, Ashkenazi/Orthodox Judaism is taking a major gamble; it will risk developing severely detrimental maladaptation in the slim chance that a major beneficial adaptation will occur, and this adaptation can then easily spread throughout the small population.  Thinking along these lines, perhaps these adaptations explains why Jews so often are more successful than others; for example, during the Middle Ages, many became wealthy bankers in Europe, and within the last century, there have been a great number of Jewish scientists who have made astounding discoveries, many winning Nobel prizes for their groundbreaking work, all occurring in the face of heavy religious persecution.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Having just used punctuated equilibrium to explain the surprising benefits of the seemingly disadvantageous Jewish sexual selection, I could now surmise that there are so many instances of religions that, on the surface appear to be highly detrimental to the advancement and evolution of the human species, yet by meticulously examining them through the lens of Darwinian evolution, can be revealed that such major behavioral components of our lives, religion, have not survived the passage of time for no reason, in no way are simply the result of genetic drift, and have deeply rooted evolutionary advantages for that religion.  This is why religion as an evolutionary adaptation has remained ubiquitous to human nature throughout the millennia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, philosophies and strong state governments can become nearly perfect replicas of religions, in regards to the societal (meaning the inclusive fitness) functions they serve.  </span><span class="c1">In China, the combination of Confucianism and a deeply </span><span class="c1">instilled national and cultural identity</span><span class="c1">, 韩 (Han),</span><span class="c1"> that can be traced back over four millennia has proved to be a perfect substitute for religion.  In the absence of a major religion, China has remained a homogenous state since the beginning of civilization, being able to survive demographically devastating conquests by the Mongols and Manchu, in addition to European imperialism, only to emerge today as arguably the foremost nation on Earth in many ways, with the largest population on Earth and what will soon be the most prosperous economy, </span><span class="c1">clear</span><span class="c1"> wins from an evolutionary perspective.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Comparatively, the ancient civilizations of the Americas, Europe, Egypt, and Mesopotamia have not </span><span class="c1">even</span><span class="c1"> come close to surviving the millennia, because in these ancient civilizations no lasting religion or sufficient substitute had yet emerged that could absorb the devastating falls of the state and help them reemerge anew as China did time and time again.  Only after the birth of Christianity and Islam did there emerge a unifying force that transcended the superficial states in Christendom and Islamdom.  As kingdoms and empires rose and fell in these areas, Christendom in Europe and “Islamdom” in the Middle East et alia proved to be the trans-civilizational ecumenes that have held their societies, the Corpus Christianum and the Ummah, respectively, together and prevented them from </span><span class="c1">ever</span><span class="c2 c1"> disappearing from history and taking their vast gene pools with them.  </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">When we then look back towards the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas, there is a stark absence of a trans-civilizational ecumene, which arose namely in Christendom, Islamdom, India, and China in both the form of a religion as well as a philosophy and national/cultural identity.  There definitely were religions in the Old World, yet none of them ever attained the position of a trans-civilizational ecumene capable of enduring the Columbian genocide, and as such has forever faded from history, surviving only as a pitiful shadow of its former self and delegated to the backwaters of modern society.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Through this search, I have come to fully appreciate the many subtle yet profound advantages religion has for its believers.  However, it is evident that in the modern world, the once vast scope and influence of religion has been greatly diminishing, and a vast slew of religious substitutes have arisen to replace an increasingly outdated societal construct that was once the epitome of human unity and inclusive fitness.  I found Elena’s ideas about how modern NGOs have begun to replace the altruistic elements in humanity that have long since been monopolized by religion to be extremely enlightening, because it helped set her and I on a path of discussing other possible religious substitutes, among which we posited both nationalism and cultural identity as viable replacements for the originally religious idea of sacrificing yourself for a cause greater than you, especially in the case of nationalism.
