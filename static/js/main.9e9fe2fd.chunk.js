This was the case for my innovative solution to the N Queens problem, which is to count the number of N by N chess boards on which N queens can be placed such that no two queens are threatening each other.  The straightforward way we learned to solve this in school was to create a 2D array as the board and recurse through the rows, placing a queen in the next open spot, and then filling in all the spots threatened by the new queen.  Since the number of solutions grows exponentially, solving the N Queens problem for much higher N is currently impossible, but nevertheless, the simple way we solved it was extremely inefficient, slow, and memory-intensive.  So I set about trying to find a more efficient way to approach the problem.\n\nThe near-optimal solution I developed approached this problem in a fundamentally different way.  Instead of representing the board as a 2D array, I represented the entire board and all the current threats in only three integers.  I used the individual bits of the integers to represent the vertical, left diagonal, and right diagonal threats, allowing me to flip a bit to place a new queen and then bitshift the diagonals to create the next row.  By taking advantage of extremely fast bit operations instead of slower loops, and by confining the memory to only three integers, I was able to run the program entirely on the tiny memory of the CPU instead of accessing comparatively slow RAM.  The result was that my program was thousands of times faster and used dramatically less memory.  Even when I searched online to see if there was a better solution, my program was 20% faster than Jeff Somers\u2019, which purports to be the world\u2019s fastest.  I am currently contacting CS professors to study the ramifications of this work and hopefully apply it to other topics."},Polybius:{brief:"TODO",description:"TODO"},ProjectScheduleViewer:{camelCase:!0,brief:"TODO",description:"TODO"},QuickTrip:{brief:"How to get there fast or cheap.",description:"QuickTrip is the ultimate travel planner.

By understanding how our own brain functions and what makes it so intelligent, we may be able to apply these techniques to the AIs we create. However, the human brain is amazingly complex with over 100 billion neurons, and currently, we understand very little of how it works. Thus, it is extremely useful to begin by studying the fruit fly brain, a much smaller, simpler brain of only 100,000 neurons that is still capable of advanced cognition beyond what we currently understand. In creating simulations of the fruit fly brain and its many neural circuits, it is vitally important to run real-time simulations that capture real-world and analyze it as a fly would. This allows us to evaluate how our model performs in the same situation as a real fruit fly. The perfect candidate for this is a fruit fly robot that can sense and behave like a real fruit fly. While simulating the physical capabilities of the fruit fly is also important, simulating the sensory input and behavior is paramount, and is focused on in this project.",s.createElement("br",null),"My role in this project was to implement the vision system of the fruit fly robot. To do so, I had to simulate the grid-like, blurred vision of the fruit fly\u2019s compound eyes, which was accomplished by using a convolution of the image frame with a gaussian kernel, in addition to simulating the same elementary motion detection algorithms that have been recently discovered in the fruit fly brain. The entire vision system was not implemented, but since motion detection and the fly\u2019s evasive response is one of the fruit fly\u2019s most used neural pathways, this was deemed sufficient for most purposes. Both the convolution and motion detection algorithms are highly parallelizable, as are the actual neural pathways in the brain, so full advantage was taken of the massive parallel processing power of the GPU, specifically the embeddable NVIDIA Jetson TX2. A major challenge in this was the real-time demand, since the camera ran at 60 frames per second (ideally, this would be set at 300 FPS, because the fruit fly\u2019s compound eye can see at a much higher rate, but the camera used could not attain 300 FPS), meaning all the image processing, convolution, and motion detection had to be performed in 1/60th of a second. Consequently, the program had to be heavily optimized for the GPU, performing copy elision so that the raw image was sent directly to the GPU and ensuring the parallel algorithms achieved maximum cache efficiency and shared memory use, most loops were unrolled to reduce instruction overhead, and striding all memory accesses to reduce shared memory bank conflicts.",s.createElement("br",null),"After 3 weeks of learning Cuda GPU programming using C, C++, and Python and the neural \u201carchitecture\u201d of the fruit fly brain, and after 4 weeks working on this project, the vision system of the fruit fly robot was complete.

It is able to track and follow a moving object, as well as speed away when an object approaches too quickly, and thus is able to mimic the behavior of the fruit fly.")}}),I=n(25),k=n.n(I),S=function(){return s.createElement(s.Fragment,null,"Smart Neural Fuzzer")},A=function(e){var t=e.data,n=t.name,a=t.brief,r=t.url;return s.createElement("div",null,"Name: ",n,s.createElement("br",null),a,s.createElement("br",null),"See source code: ",s.createElement("a",{href:r},r),s.createElement("br",null))},P=n(26);var j,F=(j=P,Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(j).flatMap(function(e){var t=Object(l.a)(e,2),n=t[0],a=t[1];return Object.entries(a).map(function(e){var t=Object(l.a)(e,2),a=t[0],r=t[1];return function(e,t,n){var a=n.brief,r=n.name,i=n.camelCase,o=void 0===i||i,l=n.file;return{name:r||(o?p:function(e){return e})(t),gitHubUser:e,repoName:t,url:"https://github.com/".concat(e,"/").concat(t).concat(l||""),brief:a}}(n,a,r)})}).map(function(e){return[e.repoName,e]}))),D=n(27),N=n(28),C=n(29);var x=function(){function e(t){var n=t.docId,a=t.title,r=t.date;Object(D.a)(this,e),this.docId=void 0,this.title=void 0,this.date=void 0,this.docId=n,this.title=a,this.date=r}return Object(N.a)(e,[{key:"url",get:function(){return function(e){var t=function(t){var n="".concat(t,"/data/writings"),a="".concat(n,"/").concat(e);return{parentDir:n,dir:a,metadata:"".concat(a,"/metadata.json"),html:"".concat(a,"/index.html")}};return{get src(){return t("src")},get public(){return t("public")},get dist(){return t("/me")}}}(this.docId).dist.html}}]),e}();var U=C.map(function(e){var t=e.docId,n=e.title,a=e.date,r=e.override,i=void 0===r?{}:r;return new x({docId:t,title:i.title||n,date:new Date(i.date||a)})}),M={Home:function(){return s.createElement(s.Fragment,null,"Home",s.createElement("br",null),s.createElement("img",{src:k.a,alt:"Picture of ".concat(y),width:"25%",height:"25%"}))},Internships:function(){return s.createElement(s.Fragment,null,"Internships",s.createElement("br",null),s.createElement(S,null),s.createElement("br",null),s.createElement(T.Preview,null),s.createElement("br",null),s.createElement(O.Preview,null))},Projects:function(){return s.createElement("div",null,Object.values(F).map(function(e){return s.createElement(A,{data:e,key:e.url})}))},Writing:function(){return s.createElement("div",null,U.map(function(e){var t=e.docId,n=e.title,a=e.date,r=e.url;return s.createElement("div",{key:t},n,s.createElement("br",null),a.toLocaleDateString(),s.createElement("br",null),s.createElement("a",{href:r},"Read it"),s.createElement("br",null))}))},Baseball:function(){return s.createElement(s.Fragment,null,"Baseball")},Resume:function(){return s.createElement(s.Fragment,null,"Resume")}},R=Object(m.a)({},T.pages,O.pages),B={main:M,sub:R,all:Object(m.a)({},M,R)},z=function(){return c.a.createElement("footer",null,"Email: ",v)},L=function(e){var t=e.pages;return c.a.createElement(c.a.Fragment,null,Object.keys(t).map(function(e){return c.a.createElement(d.b,{to:"/".concat(e),key:e},c.a.createElement("button",null,e))}))},J=function(){return c.a.createElement("header",null,y,c.a.createElement(L,{pages:B.main}))},G=function(e){var t=e.pages;return c.a.createElement(c.a.Fragment,null,Object.entries(t).map(function(e){var t=Object(l.a)(e,2),n=t[0],a=t[1];return c.a.createElement(h.b,{exact:!0,path:"/".concat(n),component:function(){return c.a.createElement(w,{title:n},c.a.createElement(a,null))},key:n})}))},H=window.location,W=Object({NODE_ENV:"production",PUBLIC_URL:"/me"}),q=(W.NODE_ENV,W.PUBLIC_URL,navigator.serviceWorker);!function(){var e=H.hostname;"localhost"!==e&&"[::1]"!==e&&e.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/)}();function Q(){return Z.apply(this,arguments)}function Z(){return(Z=Object(i.a)(r.a.mark(function e(){var t;return r.a.wrap(function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:if(!q){e.next=6;break}return e.next=3,q.ready;case 3:return t=e.sent,e.next=6,t.unregister();case 6:case"end":return e.stop()}},e)}))).apply(this,arguments)}u.render(s.createElement(function(){return c.a.createElement(w,null,c.a.createElement(d.a,null,c.a.createElement(J,null),c.a.createElement(h.b,{exact:!0,path:"/",component:function(){return c.a.createElement(h.a,{to:"/Home"})}}),c.a.createElement(G,{pages:B.all}),c.a.createElement(z,null)))},null),document.getElementById("root")),Object(i.a)(r.a.mark(function e(){return r.a.wrap(function(e){for(;;)switch(e.prev=e.next){case 0:return e.next=2,Q();case 2:case"end":return e.stop()}},e)}))()}},[[31,1,2]]]);
