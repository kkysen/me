style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c1"><span>For much of the 19th century, the Democratic Party was the party of slavery, of Jim Crow and the Solid South, of laissez-faire economics, and of states’ rights and small government.</span><span>  </span><span>Yet by the 1930s, the Democratic Party had emerged under FDR as a broad coalition that sought to revolutionize the role of the federal government and enact a welfare state, while the Republican Party had since retreated into the Democrats’ former role of big business and small government.</span><span>  </span><span>This revolution in party platforms had not occurred overnight with the election of FDR.</span><span>  </span><span>It was long in the making, but what exact dynamic led to the reversal of the core ideals of the two major US political parties?</span><span>  </span><span>The answer can be found in a third party.</span><span>  </span><span>The fundamental shift in party platforms began during the election of 1896 when William Jennings Bryan merged the Democratic and Populist </span><span>Par</span><span>t</span><span>ies.</span><span>  </span><span>By championing free silver and merging their platforms, the Democrats sought to restore core values of the traditional Democratic Party as well as their historical Southern-Western alliance.</span><span>  </span><span class="c2">Yet the Democrats also paved the way to a new frontier of populism, progressivism, and ultimately socialism, forever infusing into their party populist ideas that would go on to transform their party platform and one day enable FDR to complete the reversal, forming the core of the liberal Democratic Party known today.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>When Thomas Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party in 1791, it was devoted to opposing the Federalist policies of Alexander Hamilton that granted the federal government, and the elite, extensive powers to control the nation.</span><span>  </span><span>It idealized the independent yeoman farmer, embracing the </span><span>common man</span><span> and defending their republican values against the threat of being controlled by the elite.</span><span>  </span><span>It wanted a small, limited government that wouldn’t interfere with the lives of its citizens.</span><span>  </span><span>To an extent, they believed “the state was evil in and of itself, and the most it could do for its citizens was to attempt to restrain its greed” (Gerring 741).</span><span>  </span><span>Although the modern Democratic Party was later formed by Andrew Jackson in 1828, it evolved from the Democratic-Republican Party and remained devoted to its fundamental values.</span><span>  </span><span>Thus, in a sense, the Democratic Party was decidedly liberal for its time.</span><span>  </span><span>It fought for the people and their rights, winning a great expansion of voting rights to all white men by the 1830s (Keyssar 22-42), and it espoused classically-liberal, laissez-faire economics through low taxes and minimal regulation (Gerring 730).</span><span>  </span><span>Under Jackson, it created a strong and diverse electoral alliance, uniting not only Southern and Western farmers but also the new urban working class against their common enemy, the industrial Eastern Elite.</span><span>  </span><span class="c2">While Jackson did greatly enhance the power of the president, he did it for the people, and throughout the Jacksonian Era, these core democratic ideals remained steadfast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yet by the Civil War, the core ideology of the Democratic Party had substantially changed.</span><span>  </span><span>While some historians contend that there still was a fundamental continuity (Gerring 730-731), they cannot ignore the fact that while the new Republican Party was always staunchly opposed to the spread of slavery, the Democratic Party all but explicitly endorsed slavery.</span><span>  </span><span>It lost the broad and unique coalition it had under Jackson, regressing into an increasingly sectional party dominated by white supremacy and opposition to radical Reconstruction at all costs.</span><span>  </span><span>This Solid, white South formed the core of the Democratic Party for decades to come </span><span class="c5">(Ray 473)</span><span>.</span><span>  </span><span>It wasn’t until 1896 when William Jennings Bryan set into motion the dramatic reversal in Democratic Party ideology that this began to substantially change.  Thus, after the Civil War, the Democratic Party struggled to create the same broad, strategic voter alliance that had won them so many elections in the Jacksonian Era.</span><span>  </span><span>America was undergoing rapid change at many levels of society during the Gilded Age and yet Democratic Party ideology remained steadfast, still sticking to their previously liberal, laissez-faire economics and ideal of limited government, only now that meant allowing the elite businessmen to monopolize and oppress the common people without restraint.</span><span>  </span><span>In the face of their slipping grip on their electoral alliance, as they neared the turn of the century, Democrats realized the dire need to undergo a substantial transformation.</span><span>  </span><span>They needed to drastically expand and revitalize their electorate, they needed to stop following the exact same ideology that was </span><span>rapidly fading into the past</span><span class="c2">, and they needed to once again become the party of the people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>As the Democratic Party was faltering near the end of the 19th </span><span>century</span><span>, a new grassroots movement was brewing in </span><span>the </span><span>West.</span><span>  </span><span>Facing economic decline and obsolescence in rapidly industrializing America, </span><span>beginning in the 1860s</span><span>, farmers began to “revolt” against the business elite in the East.</span><span>  </span><span>The eastern businessmen told them </span><span class="c5">“to go to work and raise a big crop, that was all we needed” (Lease), but this only led to overproduction, which</span><span> </span><span>the railroad tycoons then exploited by charging exorbitant prices to import supplies and export grain, and which the national banks exploited by making usurious loans they knew the farmers would default on as crop prices rapidly fell (Lease).</span><span>  </span><span>In response, farmers formed the Grange, a cooperative organization that tried to circumvent the furnishing merchant and learn to industrialize themselves, working in cooperation rather than competition (“Declaration of Purposes”).</span><span>  </span><span>Yet they repeatedly lost out against the capitalist might of the East as their businesses failed and their Granger state laws regulating railroads were struck down by the Supreme Court </span><span class="c5">(Wabash v. Illinois)</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>This new wave of populism, of supporting the oppressed farmers against the corrupt and abusive elite, soon began to spread across the South and West as powerful Farmers Alliances were created.</span><span>  </span><span>United in their efforts to curb the unchecked power of the Eastern Elites, the Farmers’ Alliances joined with Silverites, socialists, labor unions, and Greenbackers to create the People’s Party</span><span> (</span><span>Klotsche</span><span> 375).</span><span>  </span><span>By 1892, the appeal of Populism had reached an all-time high.</span><span>  </span><span>In their Omaha Platform, they codified their highly progressive reforms, which included the creation of a federal subtreasury system to store surplus crops, the abolition of national banks, a graduated income tax, the direct election of Senators, an eight-hour working day, federal control of all railroads, telegraphs, telephones, and the end of the gold standard (“People&#39;s Party Platform”).</span><span>  </span><span>These progressive, liberal ideals are fundamental to modern America, yet in 1892, they were far ahead of their time and deemed extremely radical, espousing strict federal regulation of the economy in order to protect the people.</span><span>  </span><span>The People’s Party, as its name implies, was founded primarily to protect the people against the abuses of the elite, the same principle upon which both Jefferson and Jackson founded the Democratic-Republican and Democratic Parties.</span><span>  But the Populists took it once step further.  They “look[ed] to the Federal Government as the only source whence might come a panacea for the various maladies afflicting the body politic” (Ray 474).  Thus </span><span class="c2">in this new industrial age, the roles had been reversed; in order to once again become the party of the people, the Democratic Party would have to completely reverse its stance on the role of government and one day embrace the Populist idea that the government must carefully regulate the economy in order to promote the general welfare of the people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>By 1896, the Populist Party was a major force.</span><span>  </span><span>In the West and South, it controlled many state legislatures and won numerous governorships and seats in Congress.</span><span>  </span><span>Yet it had already passed its zenith in 1892, and by 1896, this party of alliances had begun to unravel, losing its ties to single-taxers, the Colored Farmers’ Alliance, the Knights of Labor, and much of its broad but disparate </span><span>coalition</span><span> (</span><span>Klotsche</span><span> 387).</span><span>  </span><span>It was clear that the Populist Party, if it stood alone, would ultimately fail; </span><span>it could never garner the widespread and loyal support the Democrats and Republicans enjoyed</span><span>, leaving hopes of engendering substantial change in the dust.</span><span>  </span><span>They had already tried to strike limited deals of electoral fusion with both major parties and were met with substantial but limited success.</span><span>  W</span><span>ith Populist Marion Butler successfully fusing with Republicans in North Carolina to sweep the state, Republicans even appeared to be taking the initiative in allying with the Populists (Edmonds 97-136).</span><span>  </span></p><p class="c1"><span>But then the dynamic of America’s political parties forever changed when William Jennings Bryan gave his electrifying Cross of Gold speech at the Democratic National Convention in 1896, endorsing the Populist ideal of the free coinage of silver and declaring, “Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.</span><span>  </span><span>You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.”</span><span>  </span><span>Bryan spoke to all Americans, not just the traditional Democratic white supremacist from the South and not just to embittered farmers either, saying, “you have made too limited in its application the definition of a businessman.  The man who is employed for wages is as much a businessman as his employer.”  He </span><span>was trying to expand the Democratic voting electorate, appealing not only to the farmers at the core of Populism, but to the entire united Populist front, from wage laborers and unions to Silverite miners.</span><span>  </span><span>Thus one of his main goals must have been to gain new voting blocks that would enable him to compete in the election even after he lost the vote of former Democratic gold standard supporters.</span><span>  </span><span>Yet Bryan went beyond just simple pandering to the voters; he attempted to restore the Democratic Party as the party of the people, of the “struggling masses, who have ever been the foundation of the Democratic Party... [against] the idle holders of idle capital” (Bryan).</span><span>  </span><span>He saw that “what we need is an Andrew Jackson to stand as Jackson stood, against the encroachments of aggregated wealth” that threatened the livelihood of the people.</span><span>  </span><span>He recognized that the Democratic Party had strayed from its original intent, and that it, the Democratic Party, not the People’s Party, must become the party of the people, both out of responsibility and a need to expand their electoral </span><span>coalition</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>However, Bryan was careful to only explicitly endorse free silver, avoiding other, significantly more radical parts of the Omaha Platform.</span><span>  </span><span>In his Cross of Gold speech, Bryan certainly appealed to the general goal of Populism, to curb the power of the Eastern Elites in order to protect the struggling masses, yet he played it safe, only ever promising to abolish the gold standard and singling out the gold standard as the primary enemy, its abolition the silver bullet to everyone’s problems.</span><span>  </span><span>This tactic exposed Bryan’s primary aim as expanding his electoral coalition, because he was only willing to adopt the part of the Populist platform that would both gain and retain the most votes, or else there would be no hope of winning the election </span><span class="c5">(“What Will They Do: Question Before the Populists” 3)</span><span>.</span><span>  </span><span>Yet this merger still managed to set in motion the ultimate transformation of the Democratic Party.</span><span>  </span><span>Even adopting free silver was fairly radical at the time, but as long as the Populists were entrenched within the party and “</span><span>the Democratic idea [was] that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it</span><span class="c2">” (Bryan), then the butterfly had already flapped its wings; it would just be 36 years before it caused a tornado.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>While the Democrats absorbed the Populists mostly out of practicality, the Populists also decided to join forces out of mutual benefit.</span><span>  </span><span>On the decline, they knew they could never win alone; their only hope was an alliance or a merger allowing them to live to fight another day</span><span> (Klotsche 389).</span><span>  </span><span>Thus when Bryan was nominated on a free silver campaign and espoused becoming the party that would fight for the struggling masses against the elite, the Populists viewed it as a compromise not exactly in their favor, but a necessary one, their saving grace against the cross of gold.</span><span>  </span><span>They knew Bryan was “</span><span>all right on the money question,... the income tax,... the railroad question,... [and] electing US senators by the direct vote of the people</span><span>” (Pence</span><span class="c5"> 3</span><span>), and thus, given their dire situation, they were willing to merge with the Democratic Party.</span><span>  </span><span class="c2">Bryan was only an ardent defender of free silver, but that was enough; the Populists knew they could ride the wave and maybe have a chance of enacting their legislation in the future.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>The election of 1896 ended with Bryan himself crucified upon a cross of gold, losing to William McKinley.</span><span>  T</span><span>he critical defeat spelled doom for Democrats for decades to come, beginning a stretch of 36 years of Republican presidents punctuated only by Woodrow Wilson’s two terms.</span><span>  </span><span>Many historians focus on this election of 1896 as a critical election, defined by V. O. Key as an election in which “the decisive results of the voting reveal a sharp alteration of the pre-existing cleavage within the electorate,” causing a lasting realignment and the formation of “new and durable electoral groupings” that persisted for many elections </span><span>to come </span><span>(4).</span><span>  </span><span>They see the election as a sudden and abrupt realignment of voters, not as the manifestation of a long period of sometimes severe but always continuously compounding change in fundamental ideology.</span><span>  </span><span>According to Walter Dean Burnham, these “mainsprings of American politics” exist in a cycle of punctuated equilibrium, the critical election realignments serving as tension-relieving transformations that punctuate the rigidness of the party system and mass electorate that dominates the years in </span><span>between</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>This idea of 1896 being a “critical” election is certainly true; there was a decisive realignment of existing voters and a shift in long-standing electoral alliances (</span><span>Barton 461-467, Ray</span><span> 474), but whether it was an abrupt change is questionable.</span><span>  </span><span>A new sectionalism was created, reuniting the South and West as they had been in Jackson’s days, and pitting them against the East in sharp contrast to the North-South sectional division that had dominated politics since slavery (</span><span>Ray</span><span> 474).</span><span>  </span><span>The Republicans did emerge dominant for decades to come, and thus in this sense, Burnham’s punctuated equilibrium appears accurate.</span><span>  </span><span>Yet Populism had been growing and evolving since the 1860s, completely transforming the party system at the local level and then, with its strategic merger with the Democratic Party in 1896, bringing the ideological revolution to a national referendum.</span><span>  </span><span>1896 certainly was a critical turning point, but it was not abrupt; party and electoral forces had gradually been building to it, and 1896 was merely a critical crescendo in which free silver was presented to the American people as a referendum on the emerging Populist movement.</span><span>  </span><span>Bryan’s brilliant fusion of the Democratic and Populist parties failed to fully overcome the tipping point, but it still caused enough platform revolution that the movement would not grind to a halt.</span><span>  </span><span>Once embedded into the inertia of a major American political party, Populist ideas were able to slowly grow and evolve, biding their time until another opportunity.</span><span>  </span><span class="c2">Bryan had presented this revolution only as a referendum on free silver at the national level, allowing the more radical and progressive elements of Populism to incubate in relative safety and obscurity, because even though America had said no to free silver, one day they would say yes to a government that would “legislate to make the masses prosperous [so that] their prosperity [would] find its way up and through every class that rests upon it” (Bryan).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>In the following elections, Bryan continued to lead this transformed party of disparate peoples united under the common banner of helping the struggling masses resist the abuses of the Eastern Elite.</span><span>  </span><span>He maintained the ardent loyalty of these people, running again in 1900 and 1908, but he failed twice more</span><span>, largely</span><span> because of the rise of Theodore Roosevelt </span><span>(Kazin</span><span> 142</span><span>)</span><span>, the toughened man of the West who took up the mantle of the </span><span>emerging progressive movement</span><span> through his Square Deal, which promised conservation, corporate control, and consumer protection.</span><span>  </span><span>For a time, it seemed as if the Republican Party was also moving in this new liberal direction.</span><span>  But at first Roosevelt was too hesitant to enact radical change and then, in 1912, Republicans rejected his rejuvenated progressivism, abandoning </span><span>their forays into progressivism.  This caused Roosevelt to run under the new Progressive Party, which split the Republican vote and their future loyalties, giving the Democrats a rare opportunity.</span><span>  </span><span>With their populist and progressive elements steadily brewing, and under the new leadership of Woodrow Wilson, the Democrats were able to pounce on the opportunity.</span><span>  </span></p><p class="c1"><span>After the long and contentious 1912 Democratic National Convention, Bryan ultimately gave his full support to Wilson, combining his loyal following with the new adherents to Wilson’s New Freedom.</span><span>  </span><span>Although this New Freedom was under a different name, progressivism, behind it lay the same forces of Populism from 1896.</span><span>  </span><span>Through the New Freedom, Wilson passed a wide array of extremely progressive legislation that was unmatched until the New Deal.</span><span>  </span><span>He took on big business head on, breaking up the big trusts, establishing the Federal Trade Commission, and passing the Clayton Antitrust Act.</span><span>  </span><span>He created the Federal Reserve System and passed the Federal Farm Loan Act, setting up banks to help farmers with their loans, just as the Populists had so desired in 1892.</span><span>  </span><span>He oversaw the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment, which enabled him to levy the graduated income tax the Populists had cried for.</span><span>  </span><span class="c2">The Populists’ dreams were finally beginning to come true; their fundamental ideas had lived on in the Democratic Party, and after 16 years, some were finally being brought to fruition.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Yet by the end of Wilson’s presidency, in the aftermath of WWI and a booming economy, the American people had enough of nationalism and popular progress; they wanted a return to normalcy (</span><span>Harding</span><span>) and to the stability of big business and conservative Republicanism that had dominated the country for decades before, and thus they ushered in yet another decade where the business of America was business (</span><span>Coolidge</span><span>), an affluent decade of great economic opportunity, but nevertheless a decade lacking the liberal progress achieved under Wilson.</span><span>  </span><span>But just as the core elements of Populism had persisted after 1896, so did the fundamentals of Progressivism after 1920.</span><span>  </span><span>While America grew complacent during the Roaring Twenties, a new liberal movement was growing behind the veneer of </span><span>credit</span><span>, a fusion of Populism, Progressivism, and socialism that would ultimately manifest under the auspices of the New Deal.</span><span class="c2">  </span></p><p class="c1"><span>By 1928, people were recognizing that the place of the Democrats was radical liberalism.</span><span>  </span><span>They saw that the Democrats had absorbed Populism “when it was the last word in radicalism” and “yet this generation has lived to see nearly every principle defended by those ‘crazy Pops’ enacted into law.”</span><span>  </span><span>They saw that the Democrats had absorbed Progressivism and radically broke up trusts and banks, but by 1928, even conservatives supported breaking them up.</span><span>  </span><span>Consequently, they equated the Democratic Party with liberalism and liberalism with progress, claiming that “they must espouse liberalism… and become once more the party of the people, before they can look forward to success” (Chamberlayne).</span><span>  </span><span class="c2">And in 1932, Franklin Delano Roosevelt did exactly that, presenting as a solution to the Great Depression that unique blend of populism, progressivism, and socialism that was known as liberalism, which, since its inception in 1896, had steadily transformed the Democratic Party, and which now enabled the Democratic Party to once again become the party of the people, forming a vast New Deal Coalition that would stand for decades and drive America to the forefront of progress in the 20th century.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Under the New Deal, FDR and Congress passed numerous acts that strictly regulated the economy, pumping life back into a dying American economy.</span><span>  </span><span>Although extremely radical in conservatives’ eyes, the vast majority of people welcomed the government creating millions of new jobs and helping to secure everyone’s ability to have a fair chance of finding work and supporting their families.</span><span>  </span><span>The great calls for government reform by the Populists in 1892 had finally been answered and accepted by the American public.</span><span>  </span><span>The New Deal’s transformation of the government’s role in the economy and everyone’s lives was revolutionary and has lasted to this day, but it is important to realize it did not come from out of the blue.</span><span>  </span><span>These forces of liberalism and Populism had been building for decades and the New Deal is where they finally found widespread acceptance.</span><span>  </span><span>But if not for Bryan’s unification of the Democratic and Populist Parties, these Populist ideas may have never found their lifeline in the evolving Democratic Party, and the Democrats may have never returned to their liberal roots.</span><span>  </span><span>It was a long and complex journey from Bryan’s adoption of Populism to the modern Democratic liberalism that emerged under the New Deal, but ultimately, it was this unification that set the evolution in motion.</span><span>  </span><span>Through the merger, Bryan reset the course of the Democratic Party to one that aligned with the views of the common man, one that sought to protect the struggling masses against the abuses of the money power and elite, and one that would forever resonate with anyone who just wanted to work hard and live a good life.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><p class="c13"><span class="c2">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c11">Secondary Sources</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span>Barton, D.
