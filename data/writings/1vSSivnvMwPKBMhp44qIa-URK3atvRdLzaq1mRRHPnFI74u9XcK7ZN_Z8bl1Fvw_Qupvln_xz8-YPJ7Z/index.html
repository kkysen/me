class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Dear Smith </span><span class="c2">(Hume, Klibansky, and Mossner 51)</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">I have delayed responding to your last letter until I could make something of the recent events in France. Forgive me but I’ll go on something of a rant here; it is a lot to take in and puts quite a lot of meaning to the French people. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Something crucial, I believe, that should be addressed is the work of Abbe Emmanuel Joseph Sieyes. Certainly, he began something crucial with his work of </span><span class="c2">“</span><span class="c2">Qu&#39;est-ce que le tiers-état? </span><span class="c2"> (Sieyes, “What is the Third Estate?”). In this essay (which I highly recommend you read—it gives excellent context for what happens later on—I’m sure you’re well-informed at this point), Sieyes outlines what he believes the Third Estate, the people below nobility and the self-righteous, so-called “religious leaders” who are in the second and first estates, respectively, should be within the French society. For speculation, I believe this essay holds some logical sense. First and foremost, we should, of course, disregard the authority of the clergy. They hold this aforementioned authority only because of divinity and their association with God. Society today is above these frivolous miracles that are created only within the context of </span><span class="c2">our primitive fear of instability</span><span class="c2"> (Hume, “The Natural History of Religion”. Section V); their authority is no longer necessary within a governed state at all because people have created </span><span class="c2">God, </span><span class="c2">not the other way around (Hume, “An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding”). While I see that Sieyes finds great injustice in the state, I do not agree with his standpoints. </span><span class="c2">The ideas are too radical, much like the Whigs in England (Coniff, “Hume On Political Parties: The Case for Hume as a Whig”).</span><span class="c2">  They are ignorant of the importance of the </span><span class="c2">monarchy (Fiefer, “David Hume (1711-1776). Introduction). </span><span class="c2">Sieyes disregards the authority of the upper class and monarchy. The letter seems to empower the common people, but in a anarchical and ideal manner that can only result in chaos because it does not give power to the people as individuals before the state, but gives power to everyone without a proper state to govern them. Moreover, it calls for revolutionary ideas and alterations to the state, but, in reality, this should be dissolved with </span><span class="c2">political moderation (Gallegos, “Hume on Revolution).</span><span class="c2"> This is the reason I agree with King Louis’ </span><span class="c1">Cahiers de doleances</span><span class="c2"> and the Estates-general that began, seemingly, as a call for compromise between the two political groups. Both, however, failed in their motives. The king failed to exercise and assert his power and the people failed to assert </span><span class="c2">a constitutional monarchy</span><span class="c2"> (Hume, “Political Writings” Essay IV). Surely, that is not the fault of the people; the king was too incompetent to realize and control the problems of the people. This resulted, inevitably, in the beginning of a revolution. The Tennis Court Oaths (the members of the third estate gathered to swear allegiance to each other and against the king), upon the king’s meek attempt to prevent the angered third estate from meeting, escalated and forced the revolution forward, affirming its dreadful occurrence. Counterintuitively, the king managed to raise the problems more with his attempts to solve them, resulting in the attack on Bastille, by July 14, 1789. </span><span class="c2">I do not believe, that these people should be given the right to revolt unless in a state of tyranny, otherwise war is a fight between political parties and not where justice is meant to prevail</span><span class="c2"> (Gallegos, “Hume of Revolution”). The third estate represents, not a group of intellectually organized individuals, but a group of people armed with passions that cause increased instability in this war. </span><span class="c2">Women empowered themselves, stepped outside of what society has made them. While that is good, I question the genuinity in their pursuit, whether the March was worth it in itself</span><span class="c2"> (Garrett, “Hume as a Man of Reason Women’s Philosopher”)</span><span class="c2"> . </span><span class="c4 c2">While the idea of a constitution was well-thought out, the execution of it so far has implied disorganization. The declaration of the Rights of Man has perpetuated the problem: allowing individuals to fight as if they act upon their own government. This gives way to more power abuse, the very thing they want to stop. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">So far, something good that has occurred is the change in religious policy. Giving church land over to the government and making the religious leaders obey the law is an advancement; it shifts us away from treating certain individuals incorrectly with regard to superiority (Kippis, “The New Annual Register” Parliamentary Debates).</span><span class="c4 c2"> </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Taking a step back now, I realize, there is a relation between our previous discussion regarding the economy. I agree, the people of France are very unsatisfied with the economy (it adds large amounts of fire to this rebellion). In this respect, </span><span class="c2">I believe the rebellion will allow for more money to be spent outside of the country</span><span class="c2"> because of recent political reforms. It is crucial to deconstruct mercantilism, primarily because it fails to recognize that increases in money within the country will always exit the country through means such as trade, it is insensible to store up money inside the country. It is healthy, and necessary, to cycle money up and down t</span><span class="c2">he economy. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">“If I add fluid to one chamber, then, under the weight of gravity, this will disperse to the others until the level is the same in all chambers. A similar phenomenon will occur if we </span><span class="c1">lose</span><span class="c2"> money in our home country by purchasing imports from foreign countries. As the quantity of money decreases in our home country, this will drive down the prices of labor and domestic products. Our products, then, will be cheaper than foreign products, and we will gain money through exports. On the fluid analogy, by removing fluid from one chamber, more fluid is drawn in from surrounding chambers.”</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Hume, “Political Discourses”. Balance of Trade)</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">I hope my letter isn’t too muddled, for there is a lot to say. I look forward to your response and to further discuss these matters with you.</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">Dear sir</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">Your most oblig’d humble Servant</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">David Hume (Hume and Greig 32-35)</span></p><p class="c17 c11"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c17 c11"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">University of Glasgow. 19 June. 1791</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Dear Hume</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">It is so good to hear from you again.  I just recently returned from touring Europe as a tutor of Henry Scott, the Duke of Buccleuch, a trip during which I even traveled to France.  I left France before all these tumultuous events you speak of ever occurred, but to imagine I had just been there and it had been a perfectly normal country?  I wrote this letter in a hurry—I only received it a few days ago—so forgive me if my thoughts are a bit long-winded and all out of order; I didn’t have much time to articulate and organize my thoughts clearly.  But after I heard about the new Le Chapelier Law (I’ll get to that a bit later), and having not heard from you in a while, I had to write back as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">My first reaction to your letter is that in Sieyes’ “What is the Third Estate?”, I believe he is completely justified in condemning the excessive privileges of the First and Second Estate.  The government has no right to give a group of people such a privilege that allows them to oppress the Third Estate.  The government should leave the people alone, and should not grant privileges that will disrupt the laissez-faire free market.  The invisible hand will be sufficient to guide all the people if they act in their own self-interest, and thus there is no need for government meddling (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).  With such excessive privileges granted hereditarily and not out of merit, the nobility will oppress the Third Estate, and thus restrain the free competition that creates a stronger economy.  If the entire Third Estate is freed according to Sieyes’ vision, then it will free more than 95% of the French people to contribute to the economy.  The disastrous effects of these privileges is readily evident in France’s current economic state under Louis XVI and terrible, lying Finance Ministers like Necker.  France’s economy is crumbling, and unless the full might of the entire population is mobilized to revitalize the economy, with the government sitting back and allowing the French people themselves to restore to France a booming economy, the situation will only worsen (although a major part of France’s current economic recession is due to them funding the American Revolution, for it is disadvantageous to have colonies to begin with, and funding a colony that is not even your own is complete and utter </span><span class="c2">stupidity</span><span class="c4 c2">) (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">I definitely do agree with your points about the clergy.  The capital wasted in religious endeavors is great, and they definitely should not receive privileges for being part of an institution that is tantamount to exalted superstition (Coase 538), especially the “stupid and lying missionaries” (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.87).  </span><span class="c2">But</span><span class="c2"> the rest of Sieyes’ points are equally valid.  What makes them so radical?  It would definitely be beneficial to France to abolish the First and Second Estates and destroy all feudal remnants that retard the power of the free market.  As I explained above, by throwing off the yoke of the oppressive nobility, the Third Estate would be able to turn around France’s precipitously declining economy by completely opening the free market to France’s massive population; once there is free competition, everyone working in their self-interest will be sufficient to reverse the economic collapse now seen in </span><span class="c2">France</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Furthermore, why are his ideas against such a strong monarchy so detrimental?  The government serves only three main purposes: to protect against violence and invasion, to maintain justice, and to erect and maintain public institutions and works (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.41, 44, 69-70).  Their main role is in abstaining from interfering in the economy, for by letting it decide its own course, it will undoubtedly seek out the best path.  Sieyes is empowering the common people—that’s true—but this will not promote anarchy and chaos; it will only serve to allow all the people to freely compete in the market, thereby greatly improving the </span><span class="c2">economy</span><span class="c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).  </span><span class="c2">You also advocated for many of these same principles the French are now fighting for during the American Revolution, and you are also a fan of our own Glorious </span><span class="c2">Revolution</span><span class="c2"> (Gallegos, “Hume on Revolution”), so I do not understand your opposition to Sieyes’ ideas, however rebellious they are</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">As for your claim that it is rebellious, that is correct only in limitation.  The Tennis Court Oath proved this.  The Third Estate, after they were prevented from properly assembling, decided to assemble elsewhere and take an oath that they will not stop assembling until the king ratifies the constitution that they will write.  All they are trying to do is establish a constitutional monarchy, one just like we have here in Great Britain.  Currently, Great Britain is the foremost economic power in Europe, and the correlation to a constitutional monarchy cannot be ignored.  But France, with its massive population of 28 million people, has the potential to take this position from England, if it is able to establish a truly free market guided only by the invisible hand and never by the government, and a necessary step in achieving this is the liberation of the entire population of France, by which everyone will be able to engage in free competition; no longer will the free market be so dominated by the nobility and even the </span><span class="c2">bourgeoisie</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">The Storming of the Bastille</span><span class="c2"> and the Women’s March on Versailles were</span><span class="c2">, I admit, unfortunate event</span><span class="c2">s</span><span class="c2"> in achieving this realization of a truly free French market. By moving the beginnings of the revolution towards violence, they will waste significant economic resources in fighting a war, while achieving their aims could perhaps have been carried out with less bloodshed.  As for the Women’s March on Versailles, the entire cause of their march was inherently flawed.  They marched on the palace demanding lower prices of bread, calling for a fixed price of grain and bread.  But the supply of bread was running low, and fixing its price only worsened the situation.  The price rises because there is limited supply, and in order to maintain their business, the farmers must raise the price.  Having a higher price will then attract others to take up the same profession, who see a chance for profit in selling the grain at such a high price.  This will consequently increase the supply, thus resulting in a lowered price.  But by fixing the price, farmers will only lose their business, and consequently produce less grain, which will only raise grain prices further.  The natural price of grain will remain constant, but the market price of grain will fluctuate in response to the supply and demand of grain.  When the effectual demand increases or the actual quantity of a commodity brought to the market is decreased, competition among the buyers will increase the market price, and the opposite occurs when the demand decreases or supply increases.  Therefore, the Women’s March on Versailles only served to further compound their plight.  The lost money that the farmers receive in payment for the grain may be subsidized by the government, but that just reallocates the debt to the national </span><span class="c2">government</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">The nationalization of church property and the </span><span class="c1">Civil Constitution of the Clergy</span><span class="c4 c2"> were certainly steps in the right direction, as you thought, but there was a major, hidden economic flaw that resulted: the Assignats.  The National Assembly was faced with an enormous national debt that only continued to grow, but in promising reform, they couldn’t further raise taxes.  Consequently, with previously Church-owned lands now in government hands, they believed they could exploit this expropriated land.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Normally, this would have crossed a line in maintaining the right to property.  This does not only apply to individuals, but must apply also to institutional property, such as that of the Church, and therefore the government cannot simply expropriate property without venturing into despotism.  Property rights are a major foundation of jurisprudence; even a starving man who steals bread must be held accountable and be brought to justice.  While the punishment might be mitigated given the extenuating </span><span class="c2">circumstances</span><span class="c2"> (Smith, “The Theory of Moral Sentiments”), it is still a crime.  Likewise, it should be a crime for the National Assembly to forcibly seize all the church property.  However, in times of emergency, the state is sui generis, and it is allowed to violate the otherwise inviolable property rights to save the nation.  This would apply to this case of nationalizing Church property if the resultant Assignats rescue the nation from its crumbling economy, but the issuance of Assignats only exacerbated France’s economic </span><span class="c2">situation</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Sagar, “Adam Smith on Property rights and His Good Sense In the Real World”; Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">This was especially true once the National Assembly decided to make the Assignats full legal tender and print 1200 million of them at denominations of 200, 300, and 1,000 livres (Trask, “Inflation and the French Revolution: The Story of a Monetary Catastrophe”).  </span><span class="c2">There</span><span class="c2"> must be a limit on the size of these banknotes and the enormous quantity printed, and the government must be able immediately exchange the Assignats for real money or something of equivalent, unchanging value (Rockoff, “Adam Smith on Money, Banking, and the Price Level”).  </span><span class="c2">They</span><span class="c2"> cannot do this, because the Assignats sold were not backed up by anything of value except the land that was expropriated from the Church.  But the value of this land has a limit, and the National Assembly decided to just keep printing more Assignats without acquiring further land.  Therefore, this will cause hyperinflation, and the Assignats will soon become practically worthless, and this will be yet another economic disaster for </span><span class="c2">France</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Trask, “Inflation and the French Revolution: The Story of a Monetary Catastrophe”; Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">But enough with all the negative aspects of revolutionary France.  Have you heard about the new Le Chapelier Law?  It was ratified only a few days ago.  It has abolished all guilds outlawed the right to </span><span class="c2">strike</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Le Chapelier)!  Finally they are moving on the path to an improved economy, advocating for free enterprise, instead of a market controlled by the despicable guilds that oppose free trade, including acting against people of the same profession who try to trade freely, and hinder the economy by not allowing for a free market.  But now there can be a free market in France, and that is truly revolutionary for a nation that in the past was an ardent advocator for that damned mercantilism.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">In reply to your linkage between the revolution and France’s economy, you already definitely agree with you.  I’ve written many letters espousing this exact economic thinking.  But one major problem with the revolution in respect towards the economy is that, fearing the fall of monarchy in France spreading throughout Europe, the revolution has made France the enemy of all the monarchs of Europe, and if war were to break out between them, it would negate any economic advantages incurred due to the newly created free market in France.  The capital that will need to be spent defending France will be necessary but costly, but if France becomes the aggressor, all that goes out the window, and France’s economy will suffer under the strains of war as trade with the other Great Powers of Europe is disrupted.  So let’s hope that the revolution will be able to resolve itself without dragging France into a war against Europe that will devastate all their economies.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">I ever am, dear Sir,</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">Most affectionately yours,</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">Adam Smith (Smith, “The Death of David Hume”).</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c11"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">Lisle Street Leicester Fields London. 30 January. 1791</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">Dear Smith (Hume, Klibansky, and Mossner 51)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">        As you might well know, King Louis has been executed, beheaded before the French public. After the abolition of monarchical power, the King was convicted and died by guillotine. This, I believe, is the beginning of more and unnecessary violence. The King had already agreed to the Constitution of 1791. This was an excellent and crucial idea; it retained the necessary components of a strong, centralized monarchy with justified representation for the people. The division of power seemed parallel with the British government, but, yet, the people remained unsatisfied. While there is speculation and perhaps evidence to support the monarchy’s lack of compliance with the contract they have signed, it does not justify their complete abolishment of the monarchy, </span><span class="c2">for what shall occur without a strong leader, a centralized group to govern the masses?  </span><span class="c2">The Storming of the Tuileries Palace was sufficient to surrender the current, insufficient and abusive monarchy; there was no need for further violence and further perpetuation of rebellion, because it is then ceaseless war, especially with the fact that there are already warnings from other countries warning against the harming of the monarchy. It is not merely placing the power of economy in the hand’s of the people (I’ll have to disagree with certain parts of improving the economy), it is about how to set a system of government. </span><span class="c2">A government comes before the economy</span><span class="c2"> because the people need a system by which to exercise their economic rights. Insofar as they have a chaotic system, they are risk of instability in their own nation, their rights will hold no utility outside. With the King and no system of monarchy to continue, the government is open for abuse; those with power who want to take it could seize control of the military and set another cycle of  tyranny. The function of the government, indeed, is the matter of its </span><span class="c2">utility for the people</span><span class="c2">. Therefore, you must agree with me when I say that a strong government must be maintained, with avoidance of conflict with other countries. While the government is still in formation, it seems to be in the nation’s best interest not to cause tensions with outside nations, yet the French people have ignored the Declaration of Pillnitz and the Brunswick Manifesto, and harmed the King and </span><span class="c2">Queen</span><span class="c2">, the latter who is the sister of the Austrian King, Leopold the Second who combined powers with the Prussian king. </span><span class="c2">My fears are correct: for soon wars began and Austria and Prussia invaded French territory (Gallegos, “Hume on Revolution”). </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">        Something I fear even more is the implication of the </span><span class="c1">La patrie en danger</span><span class="c2">. While the latter implicates the country’s centralization, both pay their regards to war and opens up for abuse. It is a fundamental flaw within the system, the nation is born of war and there is no proper political assembly to emerge, executions and escalations have allowed people to take over. Insofar as you have mentioned that I support rebellion, I do so only when the abuses are extreme and the people suffer immensely and only in cases where the</span><span class="c2"> rebellion is strategic (Gallegos, “Hume of Revolution”).</span><span class="c4 c2"> While this rebellion began strategic, its plans have fallen into disarray and this makes me fear the future of the French government. While I believe in utilizing war when necessary, a nation just born does not have the strength, even if they win the wars, to maintain itself with merely quick and unstable positions of power; they should have sought compromises with the countries against them, instead of declaring war. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">        In reply to your last letter, I agree with your points on France’s potential to rise above England in terms of economic power, yet I do not believe they are able to. Insofar as they have thrown themselves into war, they are not like England. First, I believe a stable government is necessary for a stable economy so that the people are able to jurisdict their actions and protect against outside attacks. Currently, all able-bodied men are in the army thus; whence comes the economic freedom? In that respect, I believe funding the American colonies will perhaps prove beneficial to the French, as they need more allies in these wars and trade. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">        What I truly grieve for the French, right now, are two respects: the economic endorsements and inability for the country to heal and rise itself to proper reform due to the immediacy of the wars against it and the failure of the mixed constitution. The reason the English Civil War was successful was due its ability to have found an agreement between the people of England and the monarchy. This war has resulted in the obliteration of power of one group but not so far as an establishment of the people; the result has not been strategic and sensible. Perhaps, though (and I hope), that I will be proven wrong, in which case we shall exchange relieved messages, and the government of France will be able to rise from its violent beginnings of a new nation (and a pure republic at that) and stabilize itself. In regard to your statement concerning property rights, I choose to disagree; the giving of church property in the beginning was unauthorized due to the fact that the only justification involved religion. While taking it away may be seen as unjust, the justice is dependent on the time period and necessities of the government of other groups to that property. Seeing as the government needed land and re-establishments, that is sufficient justification for the seizing of church land which they can later buy back, or individuals </span><span class="c2">can</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Waldron, “Property and Ownership” Section 1). </span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">Dear sir</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">Your most oblig’d humble Servant</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c2">David Hume </span><span class="c4 c2">(Hume and Greig 32-35).</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c17 c11"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">University of Glasgow. 26 February. 1793</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Dear Hume</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">It has been good to hear from you again.  I sympathize with your viewpoint in lamenting the path the French people have taken in executing Louis XVI, abolishing the monarchy, and declaring a republic, but there a few points that I believe you have missed.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Firstly, you asked me </span><span class="c2">what shall occur without a strong leader, a centralized group to govern the masses</span><span class="c2">, and I answer that when there is an absolute monarch controlling every aspect of a country, he is taking it into his own hands to distribute resources.  He does not have to produce anything of value in surplus, and then through truck, barter, and exchange, acquire something else that is of more value to himself.  He is usurping the power of the invisible hand, of the innate human predisposition to truck, barter, and exchange.  When the economy is left to be run by the invisible hand, through the division of labor capitalizing on a fundamental aspect of human nature, it is at its best, not at the hands of a despotic ruler.  It is the collective free market of the people at the base of society that makes capitalism run smoothly, and I know I’ve long since convinced you of the advantages of capitalism over mercantilism or any other economic </span><span class="c2">system</span><span class="c2"> (Rollert, “Does the Top Really Support the Bottom?—Adam Smith and the Problem of the Commercial Pyramid”; Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).  You are completely correct in stressing the need for a stable government, for without stability, the government cannot fulfill its purpose, and it has only three of them.  But a stable one need not be a strong one, as long as it fulfill these three purposes: to protect the nation, to maintain justice, and maintain public institutions and </span><span class="c2">works</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.41, 44, 69-70).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Secondly, you dared to say that the government comes before the economy.  Even if you really believe you’re right, I can’t believe you had the nerve to even suggest such a preposterous idea to me.  Of course the economy is more important than the government.  Economy does not require a government, it will just inherently arise when there are at least two people in the world, and they each have something the other wants, and consequently decide to trade.  Government, as long as it is limited and doesn’t interfere with the economy, will definitely help the economy by fulfilling the three purposes I listed above (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.41, 44, 69-70), but it certainly cannot claim to be more important than </span><span class="c2">economy</span><span class="c4 c2">.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Thirdly, you seem to despise the wars against Austria and Prussia.  I myself am not a huge fan either, and I regret the reasons causing the French to enter into such a war, but although I have often repeated how it was a monumental mistake for England to go to war against America, and how they shouldn’t have even colonized it in the first place, this war in France is fundamentally different.  Against America, England was fighting across an entire ocean.  There was never any threat to England itself, and thus, since it had no need to defend itself, it shouldn’t have gone to war.  Instead, they only massively increased their war debt transporting troops across the Atlantic to fight a war it didn’t even matter to them at home if they </span><span class="c2">won</span><span class="c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).  They had a professional army, and thus paid their soldiers well.  But in France, the Revolutionary Army is paid poorly, and what it is paid, it has been so inflated by the Assignats to become practically worthless and often paid many months in arrears as </span><span class="c2">well</span><span class="c2"> (Forrest 40, 50, 175), and most importantly, they are fighting to defend their nation against the Austrian and Prussian invaders.  Have you not read </span><span class="c1">La Patrie en Danger</span><span class="c4 c2">?  I agree that France didn’t necessarily have to get dragged into this war in the first place, but it is definitely a just war, especially considering that there is so much rampant French nationalism and patriotism that the citizens, in particular the sans-culottes, who practically go to war, sacrificing their life for their nation, for free (I mean, there are hordes of entire volunteer divisions), which means that the war is much less of a burden on the economy than the American Revolutionary War and it is for a vastly more important cause.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Fourthly, you also even had the nerve to say that you think it is wise for France to be funding America.  Have I not told you so many times in the past how it was a disaster for England?  And France didn’t even own the colonies; they received nothing in return.  You’re suggesting that they might become a French ally, but America is across the ocean.  How can they help the plight of the French from across the Atlantic when they are so young and have such a puny army and navy.  When England tried to do the same thing, they failed, even though they arguably have the strongest military, and most definitely the best navy, in the world.  This is money ill spent, and it would be wiser to invest it in France’s own economy, for you need to spend money to make money, and America is definitely not making money for France, while their own people surely could improve their economy.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Fifthly, you have also claimed that when a new nation is created, it doesn’t have the strength to fight wars immediately.  I choose to disagree.  Most new nations are born of war, of a revolutionary war, and thus are in a prime position to wage war afterwards.  Then you said that even if they can win wars, they cannot maintain themselves and establish stable positions of power.  But have you not studied the great empires of shepherds.  Have you not heard of the Tartar and Arab shepherd </span><span class="c2">militias</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.25)?  After centuries of civil war, they both created a new state, and went on to create the two largest empires known to man, that of the Arabs united by Mohammed (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.4) being nearly tied with the current Spanish Empire, and that of the Tartars united by Genghis Khan (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.4) being larger than even the mighty British Empire.  Although the Tartars couldn’t last two centuries (which is still a very long time), the Arabs created the Islamic Caliphates, whose incarnation still recently existed in the empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals from the Atlantic to the far reaches of India.  The Safavids have declined, but the other two still remain, and have had stable governments for many centuries.  The Ottomans have lasted for five centuries, and are not showing signs of stopping any time soon.  So when a nation born of war has lasted that long and has been that prosperous, how can you claim such a thing?</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Lastly, you have responded to my thoughts on the nationalization of Church property with such fury that I believe you misunderstood me.  I said that under normal circumstances, such a seizure violates the inviolability of property, and should thus be condemned, but this is a rare exception, for it is a matter of a state emergency.  However, despite being a state emergency, the National Assembly used it to print Assignats, a disaster that only worsened the economy, the very thing they were trying to improve through their emergency seizure of property.  Therefore, it was a huge mistake to invoke emergency powers to violate the otherwise inviolability of property, the basis of trade, and thus the foundation of </span><span class="c2">capitalism</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">I ever am, dear Sir,</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">Most affectionately yours,</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">Adam Smith (Smith, “The Death of David Hume”)</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">P.S.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">I was hoping we could meet in the near future to further discuss these startling new events (and more radical ones just keep appearing).  I know you often return to your childhood home in Ninewells near Berwickshire (Hume and Greig 35), so when you return home to Scotland for a bit, perhaps we could arrange a meeting.  I would also like to invite Mr. Francis Hutcheson, my great mentor, to the meeting.  I understand you are also good friends with him, or have at least often corresponded with him (Hume and Greig 32-35).  I hope we will meet soon.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c8 c11"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">Dear Sir</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">In light of recent events, I am sure that there are certain opinions you shall change from your last letter. My fear of violence, of meaningless bloodshed has, indeed, come true. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">In response to your belief that the economy is better without a centralized monarchy, I believe I can answer both this and your point regarding the economy coming before the government with the Reign of Terror. Indeed, the Committee of Public Safety and the Jacobins had given the people more economic freedom, but the extension of time and war has had them place France into a battle between political parties. The government is essential to the functionality of the economy, if the Terror continues to assert itself over the French people, it will be impossible to raise the economy. That is, essentially, why I believe the government (an establishment of a good one, at least) must come before the economy, especially in the face of a recent revolution. Now, we can see the result: the country has devolved into bloody executions on guillotines that do not ring with justice. Insofar as any government has to contain a struggle between </span><span class="c2">liberty</span><span class="c2"> and power, liberty justifies rebellion so long as it is achieved and, currently, no liberty has been established, economic or social (“</span><span class="c2">David Hume on the origin of government in warfare, and the “perpetual struggle” between Liberty and Power”)</span><span class="c2">. You can tell me that economical values will rise if there remains only two individuals in the world, but I believe that is a flaw in your argument for two people are an insensible representation of the masses. Since we do not live in such a world (if we did, it would appear that we are the only two correspondents that speculate with each other), it is crucial to realize that while some conception of the economy can exist without a government, economic freedom cannot exist without the government, otherwise it would just be people trading in a state of anarchy. This is why I believe in a mixed constitution, for it is the best representation of both the people and their p</span><span class="c2">sychological need to follow a powerful individual, the biggest justification for why a monarchy is essential for the people (Fieser, “David Hume (1711-1776). </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">You mention how a country is most powerful after a war and I can agree with that, but since the French government has not been established and, now, the country is left to fight another bloody battle within themselves, the people are not powerful and the recent Levee en masse is another perpetuation of this violence. When, I wonder will this violence stop? The </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c4 c2"> holds some disturbing implications and, does not, help the case of the French. This constitution gives them the right to revolt and to assert oneself over the sovereignty. A right to revolt is very vague, rebellion should not be this easily justified. To assert oneself over sovereignty is to force power to win over liberty, what shall happen when each individual wants the highest position? The answer: The current state of France. Whence does a country emerge from its war-like origins? When individuals have experienced, they have learned and this is the ultimate gain from living, yet to live in a state of war is to live in a state that restricts one’s ability to learn and the French people suffer from this. The French need a secure system. In order to deliver laws that are concrete, unlike the allowed infringement the constitution asserts (since a constitution ought to be an agreement to the people, changing it should be through political actions, not rebellion), there needs to be a system that speaks to liberty for future generations and peace, something the French are deprived of. A virtuous state is a moral one and the establishment of the Terror, Thermidorian rule and execution of Olympe de Gouges are not made in a moral state. Those who are indifferent promote peace, open rebellion should never be promoted for now the fire appears ceaseless. Advocating for women’s rights is justified, their disabling effect in society is caused by the subordination they faced. The reason they are inferior and assigned to inferior roles in society is because they have not accessed their potential within it; the death of Olympe de Gouges is a tragedy to what could prove to be an important movement but yet another example of a need for a more stable state in France. </span></p><p class="c11 c17"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">Ninewells near

and just a little over a week ago, the National Convention ratified a new </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 9 Fructidor 1795</span><span class="c2">.  It is very different from the last Constitution of 1793, which in theory set up a government system, in which, for example, the power to enact measures for the common peace and safety and the power to accuse people of conspiracies against the common safety of the republic was invested in the legislative body, in addition to the power to establish the armed forces, the power to declare war, the power to nominate and depose the commander-in-chief, and the power to oversee the defense of the nation were all invested in the legislative body, the National </span><span class="c2">Convention</span><span class="c2"> (Collot d’Herbois et al., </span><span class="c2">“Acte constitutionnel precede de la declaration des droits de l&#39;homme et du citoyen : presente au peuple francais, par la Convention nationale, le 24 juin 1793, l&#39;an deuxieme de la republique”)</span><span class="c4 c2">.  </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">However, as soon as the Jacobins gained the majority in the National Convention, they established the Committee of Public Safety as the de facto executive body.  This committee did not at all abide by the powers granted to and restricted from it in the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c2">, and instead usurped many of the legislative powers, assuming the power to oversee the defense of nation against both foreign invasion and internal rebellion and gaining broad powers over the military, judicial, and legislative </span><span class="c2">bodies</span><span class="c2"> (“Committee of Public Safety”).  The </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c2"> and the new </span><span class="c1">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen</span><span class="c2"> that was ratified concomitantly were suspended on October 10, </span><span class="c2">1793</span><span class="c4 c2"> (“Committee of Public Safety”).  It was this Committee of Public Safety, dominated by Maximilien Robespierre, which came to dominate the entire supposedly republican government, suppressing Jacobin enemies through the Reign of Terror.  </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Therefore, I cannot see how you arrived at the conclusion that the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c2"> holds some disturbing implications.  It certainly was not very effective, and that is a major reason why so much normal government powers invested in the legislative, executive, and judicial bodies by the </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c2"> were usurped by the Committee of Public Safety.  But the </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c2"> was not at fault.  It was fairly just and balanced, just not effective at the time.  As for the new Declaration that was ratified concomitantly, it was an extreme supporter of liberty and equality, saying that man’s natural and imprescriptible rights (Herault de Sechelles and Leon de Saint-Just, “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen from the Constitution of Year I” Article 1) are equality, liberty, security, and property (Herault de Sechelles and Leon de Saint-Just, “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen from the Constitution of Year I” Article 2), all men are equal by nature and before the law (Herault de Sechelles and Leon de Saint-Just, “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen from the Constitution of Year I” Article 3), liberty is the power to do whatever is not injurious to others (Herault de Sechelles and Leon de Saint-Just, “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen from the Constitution of Year I” Article 6), and all have the right to the freedom of the press, peaceably assembly, and freedom of religion (Herault de Sechelles and Leon de Saint-Just, “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen from the Constitution of Year I” Article 7).  It even says those who may incite, expedite, subscribe to, execute, or cause to be executed arbitrary legal instruments are guilty and ought to be </span><span class="c2">punished</span><span class="c2"> (Herault de Sechelles and Leon de Saint-Just, </span><span class="c2">“Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen from the Constitution of Year I” Article 12</span><span class="c2">), which, if it had not been suspended, would have made the Reign of Terror inherently guilty.  From this stems my confusion; I do not understand why the </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c2"> and </span><span class="c1">Declaration</span><span class="c2 c4"> hold such disturbing implications.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Now back to my original thoughts.  Robespierre’s Reign of Terror against the “enemies of the </span><span class="c2">people</span><span class="c2">” (Robespierre, “On the Moral and Political Principles of Domestic Policy”) was justified in that “to found and to consolidate among us this democracy, to realize the peaceable rule of constitutional laws, it is necessary to conclude the war of liberty against tyranny and to pass successfully through the storms of </span><span class="c2">revolution</span><span class="c4 c2">” (Robespierre, “On the Moral and Political Principles of Domestic Policy”).  But this new constitution has created an oligarchical executive branch and a bicameral legislative branch, the former composed of five directors, and the latter composed of two houses: the Council of Ancients that holds 250 electors, and the Council of 500.  </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">This new government has been born of the coup d’etat of 9 Thermidor, not by peaceful political action, as you say it should be.  But you cannot argue that letting the Reign of Terror continue as hundreds are guillotined to death is better than have a quick coup d’etat that establishes a better government.  The coup d’etat successfully removed the despotic proto-dictator named Robespierre and opened the stage for this new government under the Directory, which certainly holds more hope for liberty than the Reign of Terror.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Therefore, instead of attempting to reform the government through peaceful political action, as you say it should be done, fire must be fought with fire (V.i.48), as Shakespeare once said.  Look at the fate of Olympe de Gouges.  A Girondin, she stood up for women’s rights peacefully and attempted to gain more rights through normal political action, but she ended up guillotined to death.  But the Girondins later learned to fight fire with fire and topple Robespierre’s proto-dictatorship through a coup d’etat, rather than attempting to reform peacefully, which likely would have ended in them receiving the same fate as Olympe de Gouge and the thousands of other Girondins who met their demise at the falling blade of the guillotine.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">I’m not saying that this new government under the Directory has achieved the aims of the revolution.  It is now instead dominated by the Girondins instead of the Jacobins, and the liberty of the all the people has not been completely gained.  There will likely be considerable corruption in this new Directory, their conservative liberalism will strand them between the radical, Rousseau-ist Jacobins and the ultraconservative royalists, and it is unlikely that the economy will considerably improve under their leadership.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">You say that liberty justifies rebellion, but that liberty has not yet been achieved.</span><span class="c4 c2">  That is why the revolution continues, and it will continue until the people are liberated.  Most of these revolutionary goals will likely be realized by a new government in the near future, the revolution will finally end as equality is ensured for all, and mark my words, France will then emerge, a nation born of war, as the strongest nation in Europe ever seen since the days of Rome.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">I also noticed in your letter that even after my tirade in the last letter about how economy comes before government, you still dare to dispute this fact of human nature.  You tell me that my analogy about how economy can arise between only two people is flawed because it is a false representation of reality, in which there are masses of people.  But my point was just a hypothetical to show that economy requires little to arise, considerably far less than government requires.  Economy will act in the same manner on a larger scale, just with vastly more interconnected relationships of trade.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">I wholeheartedly agree that a good, stable government tremendously helps the prosperity of an economy by maintaining security, justice, and public institutions and works, as I have repeatedly stated in my past letters.  I never said that an anarchical economy is any good; all I said that even with anarchy, there still is economy, but there is no longer government.  Therefore, economy transcends the reaches of government, and certainly becomes before government, because in the early days of man, when man’s population had not yet reached a certain threshold after which governments can start to be effectively formed to protect the people, economy came first, long before government ever existed.  To state it clearly and hopefully for the last time, economy comes before government, government comes before a strong economy, and monarchy comes before nothing.  Think about it this way: if economy didn’t come before government, then while the people are trying to form a new government, most people would starve to death, because they themselves as an individual do not have the skill to procure for themselves a sufficient amount of food to survive.  There is a division of labor that is allowed for because humans have a natural propensity to trade, thus leading to economy, but if this economy does not come first, then every person would have to survive individually as animals do.  Since there is a division of labor, most people are specialized in one skill, but this skill does not cover everything.  They procure other needed materials by trading their surplus of the material they are specialized in producing.  Therefore, if this trading, the economy, was suspended while the people tried to reform the government, the people would likely not </span><span class="c2">survive</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Look at the shepherd economy, like that of the Tartars and Arabs.  Before they descended upon the civilized world, when they were still contained to their steppe and their desert, they barely had any form of government.  They had tribal leaders, but they hardly qualify as a form of government, and even if they did, they hardly qualify for the strong, centralized government that so pleases you for whatever unfathomable reason that clouds your mind.  If you claim they do have a government, they certainly don’t have organized laws, only customs, or public institutions or works.  Yet they still had a sufficiently thriving economy for their needs.  For example, there might be a man who is skilled in making bows and arrows, but he has little food.  Therefore, through treaty, barter, and purchase, the man can obtain from another the greater part of the mutual good offices which he is in need of, thereby obtaining cattle or venison to feed himself, more than he could have acquired by himself through hunting, because the men from whom he obtains the food are better skilled than he at acquiring such food, just as he is better than they at making bows and arrows.  It is by this trucking disposition that the division of labor is originally </span><span class="c2">occasioned</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” I.2.3), meaning that even without government, a division of labor can successfully be implemented.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Furthermore, the consumable nature of the property of shepherds, which mainly consists of weapons and food in the form of cattle, renders all regulations by law impossible and useless in nations of shepherds like that of the Tartars and </span><span class="c2">Arabs</span><span class="c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” III.4.16).  In addition, the Tartar economy can be considered greater than that of the Spanish with their damned mercantile system.  When the Spanish landed in America, they first attempted to see if there was any gold or silver in the vicinity to know if they should invade or not.  Similarly, Plano Carpino, an ambassador to Batu Khan, often was asked if France was rich in cattle and oxen, meaning that Batu Khan was trying to assess if it would be worth conquering France (Thankfully, he decided it was not, and only conquered the plains of Poland and Hungary that were well suited for grazing.)  Therefore, while in Spain, value is measured by its equivalent worth in bullion, but in the nation of Tartars, value is measured by its equivalent worth in cattle.  Out of these two, the Tartar notion of wealth is closer to the truth; bullion has little practical use (gold and silver are weak metals, ill-suited for fashioning weapons out of them), but cattle can do </span><span class="c2">work</span><span class="c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” IV.1.2).  Ergo, a nation of wandering shepherds, Tartary, has an economy greater than that of Spain with its absolute monarchy, and when united under Genghis Khan (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.4), trade across that massive empire from the Danube to the Sea of Japan was immense, given that peoples so far, on opposite sides of the world, had large differences in their respective divisions of labor, and thus products produced in Asia and the Middle East were in great demand in Europe, and vice versa.  This meant that there was an enormous demand in all areas of the empire and its frontiers, thus creating enormous profit and the potential for economic might that would have rivaled even Britain’s if the empire had remained </span><span class="c2">unified</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">I also found the new calendar France has created to be very intriguing.  It is an almost entirely decimal system, which makes standardization easy.  But more than that, because of its decimal nature, each week lasts ten days instead of seven, meaning that people will do more work, which will result in increased wages and profits, which only leads to increased trade, which circles back to increasing profits, and thus the economy might be strengthened.  That you said women’s potential must be fully accessed did not escape my sight, and I have no arguments against it, only a question: how exactly do you propose this be accomplished?  Women must have been trying to achieve this for millennia with only the occasional success born of luck and circumstance.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">I’ll conclude this letter by bringing up one of your other points: that people have a psychological need to follow a powerful individual.  I certainly do not.  I follow my own self-interest, and thereby contribute to the economy.  </span><span class="c2">Society as a whole follows the invisible hand, which guides their self-interests in such a benevolent way to strengthen the economy.</span><span class="c4 c2">  Who has ever said this?  You?  Then maybe you should follow me and my revolutionary ideas about economy.  Perhaps you can even follow me through a revolution of my own, a one of economic nature, when my legendary capitalist ideas finally come to fruition.  Mark my words, this will one day happen, and people will see the wonders of capitalism dominating the economy across the world.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">I ever am, dear Sir,</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">Most affectionately yours,</span></p><p class="c5"><span

class="c4 c2">Dear Sir</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">The </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1795</span><span class="c2"> has fallen and the revolution is officially over. Several points, I believe, should be speculated and clarified. You have responded to my take on the second </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c2"> holding disturbing implications justifying it, but my point remains; it is disturbing to give people the right to rebel, for the act of justifying rebellion is arbitrary and vague. France’s violence has stemmed from this, people have rebelled but the </span><span class="c2">conclusion is late-coming</span><span class="c4 c2"> and many deaths have been caused. Finally, now, the country has emerged from war and now begins the struggle between power and freedom. I hope, with Napoleon, there will be political moderation.  </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">I agree with your point about the Jacobins and Robespierre whole-heartedly; a contract, a constitution between the people and the government must be followed. The desires of each individual or, even, the ideas of important individuals should not be valued over the masses. The breach of the constitution is asking for rebellion and, in this way, severe abuse justifies revolt insofar as the result is clear and progresses the country further. As for your point about France emerging as a strong country, I hope that, with time and economy, a government will be established that chooses to balance the struggle for power and the need for freedom. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">I believe I was a bit distressed last letter, for I expressed a lot of it through my frustration with the state of the revolution but that is only because violence, to me is frustrating in the political world as it had seemed fruitless for the French to suffer further abuse of power and tumultuous fighting. Like the human mind, the political world divides itself into </span><span class="c2">calm and violent</span><span class="c4 c2"> and it is of the utmost importance to contain and minimize violence and venture into calm. (Hume, “A Treatise of Human Nature.” Book II)</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Moving back a little, I am surprised you did not offer an opinion on the establishment of the payment of taxes under the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1795</span><span class="c2">. Hypothetically, I agree with the intentions behind this constitution. With intent to meet both the needs of the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c4 c2"> and to end the Terror, it sought to establish social order and bring about peace. However, this, of course, proves to be idealistic as it assumed too much power to the Directory and the taxation led furthered the economic crisis and dissatisfaction among the people. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Leaving Emmanuel Sieyes (we’ve discussed him before, his politically-radical and dangerous mind enters the picture again) in a position of power actually resulted in something good.</span><span class="c2"> Despite writing the Constitution, he dislike it after seeing how the Directory used it</span><span class="c2">. Cou</span><span class="c2">p d’état</span><span class="c2 c21"> </span><span class="c2">led to Napoleon’s success in toppling and taking over the Directory. (Sieyes, </span><span class="c4 c2">“Emmanuel Joseph Sieyes: The Essential Political Writings.” Introduction)</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Napoleon, I believe, is the key to France’s emergence from war and chaotic disorder. Referencing to his success in Austria with the Treaty of Campo Formio, he brings an establishment of power and justice, control but not abuse. Furthermore, he has wisdom, as can be seen in his success against the Royalists revolts. His time as general has given him a sense of efficiency, on how to most effectively use war and this was proved in this battle. His defending of the Directory in this one instance is because he realizes that Royalist power is flawed; their religious views that the French should convert back to Christianity is absolutely absurd. Finally, the political world begins to realize that we need to shift away from religious models and arbitrary distinctions (that are related to religion and in our world) and move onto practical good and the Royalists want to change that. Had they won, you would be listening to an even angrier rant but, much to your favor, you will not be for Napoleon is good in what he does. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Speaking of religion, I am slightly concerned about your reference to this guidance by an “invisible hand”. Hopefully, you are not referring to some divine being or otherwise unwarranted guidance. Do not be misguided, Smith! If you are referring to practical reason, I can breathe a little easier, since we both understand that practical reason is a </span><span class="c2">slave to the passions</span><span class="c2"> (Hume, “A Treatise of Human Nature.” Book II) So I am very concerned, dear friend, for I would have hoped my preachings had some effect on you. (Perhaps, it is my paranoia and old-age, resulting in my </span><span class="c2">general lack of cheer</span><span class="c4 c2">)  (“The Death of David Hume”). </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">PS: I am feeling ill, so I did not address the address the issue about the economy but I believe we shall have to agree to disagree. We can both agree that the economy is, indeed, important and that the government either fosters a better economy or is important for it. </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Dear sir</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">Your most oblig’d humble Servant</span></p><p class="c17"><span class="c4 c2">David Hume.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">Lisle Street Leicester Fields London.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">June. 21 1799 (Hume and Greig 32-35).</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c11"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">Dear Hume</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">You have chosen again to assert that the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c2"> holds disturbing implications, specifically that it is disturbing to give the people the right to rebel.  But let me just say that nowhere in the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c2"> does it say, neither explicitly nor implicitly, that the people may violently </span><span class="c2">rebel</span><span class="c2"> (Collot d’Herbois et al., “Acte constitutionnel precede de la declaration des droits de l&#39;homme et du citoyen : presente au peuple francais, par la Convention nationale, le 24 juin 1793, l&#39;an deuxieme de la republique”).  It does, however, guarantee the right to petition and the right to peaceably </span><span class="c2">assemble</span><span class="c2"> (Collot d’Herbois et al., “Acte constitutionnel precede de la declaration des droits de l&#39;homme et du citoyen : presente au peuple francais, par la Convention nationale, le 24 juin 1793, l&#39;an deuxieme de la republique” Article 122), yet aren’t these types of political action exactly the political moderation that you so desire?  In the </span><span class="c1">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen of 1793</span><span class="c2">, the last article does say that insurrection is for the people if the government violates the rights of the </span><span class="c2">people</span><span class="c2"> (Herault de Sechelles and Leon de Saint-Just, “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of Citizen from the Constitution of Year I” Article 35), but no one ever violently rebelled while this </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c2"> and </span><span class="c1">Declaration</span><span class="c2"> was still in effect; only after the Committee of Public Safety usurped power and the </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c4 c2"> was nullified did the people rise up on 9 Thermidor to depose Robespierre and his malevolent, dictatorial Reign of Terror.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Furthermore, you say that the act of justifying a violent rebellion is arbitrary and vague, and that is the main reason why it should be avoided, because it cannot be impartially determined if it is justified or not.  But then you also say that severe abuse justifies revolt insofar as the result is clear and it progresses the country further.  But these two statements are hypocritical.  If you actually listen to your own words, you’ll immediately realize that severe abuse and progress are likewise arbitrary and vague, and thus cannot impartially justify a rebellion.  Therefore, you should condemn this thinking, not hypocritically and duplicitously condone it.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">It appears that I have overlooked the clauses concerning taxation in all three of the </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c2">s.  In the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1791</span><span class="c2">, the payment of taxes was what differentiated between active and passive citizens; if you could pay taxes, then you gained the full political rights of an active citizen, but if you couldn’t pay taxes, then you forfeited these political rights as a passive citizen who only retained their natural, human, and civil rights that are </span><span class="c2">unalienable</span><span class="c2"> (L’Assemblee Nationale de Franc</span><span class="c2">e, “Decret de L’Assemblee Nationale. du trois Septembre 1791. La Constitution Francaise. Declaration dea droits de l’homme et du Citoyen”</span><span class="c2">).  The </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1793</span><span class="c2"> was significantly more radical, having been written by the radical </span><span class="c2">Montagnards</span><span class="c2"> (Collot d’Herbois et al., “Acte constitutionnel precede de la declaration des droits de l&#39;homme et du citoyen : presente au peuple francais, par la Convention nationale, le 24 juin 1793, l&#39;an deuxieme de la republique”), rather than the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1791</span><span class="c2">, which still proposed a constitutional monarchy rather than a </span><span class="c2">republic</span><span class="c2">  (L’Assemblee Nationale de France, “Decret de L’Assemblee Nationale. du trois Septembre 1791. La Constitution Francaise. Declaration dea droits de l’homme et du Citoyen”).  Accordingly, it decreed that there be a uniform tax paid by all citizens, regardless of </span><span class="c2">everything</span><span class="c2"> (Collot d’Herbois et al., “Acte constitutionnel precede de la declaration des droits de l&#39;homme et du citoyen : presente au peuple francais, par la Convention nationale, le 24 juin 1793, l&#39;an deuxieme de la republique” Article 101).  But then the somewhat recent </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1795</span><span class="c2"> took a step backwards.  It attempted to find a middle ground between the radical Jacobins and traditional royalists, and thus was liberally </span><span class="c2">conservative</span><span class="c2"> (Convention Nationale de France,</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c2">“Constitution de la République Française du 5 Fructidor l&#39;an III”</span><span class="c2">).  Therefore, while it never recreated the distinctions between active and passive </span><span class="c2">citizens</span><span class="c2">  (Convention Nationale de France,</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c2">“Constitution de la République Française du 5 Fructidor l&#39;an III”), it alluded to a similar franchise based on the payment of taxes, which stems from wealth, in saying that the contributions, meaning taxes, of all kinds are distributed among all taxpayers in proportions to their means, meaning in proportion to their </span><span class="c2">wealth</span><span class="c2">  (Convention Nationale de France,</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c4 c2">“Constitution de la République Française du 5 Fructidor l&#39;an III” Article 306), which insinuates a franchise based on wealth.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">In my book </span><span class="c1">The Wealth of Nations</span><span class="c2">, I have outlined four basic maxims for taxation, which can be summarized as equity, transparency, convenience, and efficiency.  If all four of these tax maxims are abided by, in addition to levying the least amount of taxes to support a limited government (Walton, “Adam Smith on Taxes”) that serves its three main purposes, to defend the state, to maintain justice, and maintain public institutions and works (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.41, 44, 69-70), as well as maintaining the free market, then the nation will maximize its potential wealth.  However, the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1795</span><span class="c2"> is not specific in any of these areas except taxing the people equitably </span><span class="c2">(Convention Nationale de France,</span><span class="c1"> </span><span class="c2">“Constitution de la République Française du 5 Fructidor l&#39;an III”)</span><span class="c2">, so that is the only maxim I will focus on.  When the </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c4 c2"> stipulates in Article 306 that the contributions of any kind are distributed among all taxpayers in proportion to their means, it is basically saying that all taxes are to be paid in proportion to an individual’s ability to pay, meaning equitably.  </span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">This is similar to how when a carriage passes over a highway or a bridge, or how when a lighter sails upon a navigable canal, it must pay a toll, which is basically a tax, in proportion to their weight or tonnage.  Therefore, they are paying for the maintenance of these public works exactly in proportion to the wear and tear which they occasion of them, and this is the most equitable way to fund the government so that it can maintain such works.  This tax is eventually transferred to the consumer, for an increased toll results in an increased price of the goods, and thus consumers equitably pay the taxes on the goods that they buy.  However, the price of transportation is far more reduced by the public works than it is by the toll that is paid to use them, and thus it is still advantageous to both the transporter and buyer, because they gain from the works more than they lose from the toll they pay for it.  Thus this is the most equitable method of taxing, to pay in proportion to the wear and tear which they occasion of the public works </span><span class="c2">(Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.74)</span><span class="c4 c2">.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Such equitable taxing can also be applied to the annual property and income tax that is stipulated in Article 303 of the </span><span class="c1">Constitution</span><span class="c4 c2">.  It is the job of the government to defend the nation, maintain justice, and erect and maintain public institutions and works, but the government must be somehow funded, and this is done through taxes.  But since the government serves the rich more than the poor, for the government protects the greater wealth and income of the rich from crime and invasion and grants them greater privileges in using the public institutions and works, it is most equitable for the rich to contribute a greater amount to the funding of the government.  The rich are paying more taxes because they are paying taxes in proportion to the security of their wealth that they occasion of the government.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">Now let’s desist from further discussing taxes.  I doubt such lengthy explanations interest you much, but you can always reread my </span><span class="c1">The Wealth of Nations</span><span class="c2"> if you wish to know more.  Speaking of religion, I remain as atheist as you.  You might think that this invisible hand that I sometimes reference (which I actually referenced only once in my book </span><span class="c1">The Wealth of Nations</span><span class="c4 c2"> (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”)) is somehow some divine being that guides humanity, and specifically its economy.  But I only meant to use it as an economic principle, never as a supernatural force (Coase 538).  When every individual pursues his self-interest, it ultimately creates the best possible economy, and rather than intricately explaining the complex process by which one leads to the other, I simply summarized this process as the “invisible hand” to make it simpler to discuss.  It seems as if it is a supernatural force guiding the economy, but in reality, that is just what it appears to be, and is actually just the name I gave to the process by which individual self-interests are compounded into the economic interest of the nation (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).  This invisible hand is akin to gravity.  Newton has determined the elegant laws of nature by which gravity governs all massive bodies, but this innate, inherent, and essential fundamental force that is called gravity acts upon a distance and it cannot be determined how this occurs without a mediating material, and even Newton himself left the question of whether this mediating agent is material or immaterial to his readers.  Likewise, the “invisible hand” is an economic “force” that compounds individual self-interests into national interest somehow through the free market, but this exact method of transduction is highly complex and even I am not entirely sure of its many intricacies.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">As for this new First Consul, the new leader of France, </span><span class="c4 c2">I agree with you, for the most part, in your view of Napoleon.  He is a great stabilizing force in a nation undergoing a revolution, and under his consulate I hope to see a great economic recovery.  But I fear he has too great a propensity to wage excessive, entirely offensive war.  He invaded Egypt in the hopes that he might colonize it.  Colonization is never a good idea; just look at Britain’s debt after the American Revolutionary War (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).  To compound this error, Napoleon didn’t even win in Egypt, because although he soundly defeated the Mamluk forces in the Battle of the Pyramids, he lost his fleet to Horatio Nelson in the Battle of the Nile, and consequently was forced to desert his standing army of highly-skilled, battle-hardened veterans.  In Italy, instead of only defending France’s southeastern border with Piedmont, Napoleon waged an offensive war in Italy, conquering instead of defending territory, establishing republics in Italy, and almost invading Austria, all while his nation at home was struggling through a revolution.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Although he did sign the Treaty of Campo Formio to end the War of the First Coalition and establish peace with Austria and Prussia, he has now ascended to great power as First Consul, and I don’t see him being keen on maintaining that peace, and neither do his enemies, especially our own country.  No matter how amazing a general he is, and no matter how inflamed with patriotism the French soldiers are, the Grande Armee stands no chance facing off against the Great Powers of Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Britain.  Yet unlike Robespierre, who put hordes of people to death at the guillotine, hordes of Frenchmen will willingly follow Napoleon, who has become extremely popular due to his successful campaigns and for putting down the royalist insurrection in Paris on 13 Vendemiaire, to their own graves if it means they will be serving him, and through him the patrie.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c4 c2">Thus Napoleon will be able to amass a standing army that could spell the demise for the French First Republic, just like Caesar marched his standing army of Roman legions across the Rubicon to end the Roman Republic, and like how Cromwell purged the Long Parliament with his standing army, the New Model Army.  But a standing army is not always dangerous to liberty, and it can at time even be favorable to it, becoming its most ardent defender (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.40), like the standing army of Scipio in the face of the standing army of Asdrubal in the Alps and the standing army of Annibal at Zama during the Second Carthaginian War (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations” V.1.30-33).  Is Napoleon repeating the mistakes of Mark Antony, who also lost in the Eastern Mediterranean, or is he repeating the empire-building grandeur of Augustus, who also won on land in Egypt (Smith, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”).  Thus this remains the question: will Napoleon, with the full might of the standing army of France, the Grande Armee, at his back, cross his Rubicon like he has already invaded Rome and appoint himself a dictator, the Emperor of the First French Empire, or with this unprecedented standing army will he choose to defend the Consulate and the French First Republic to the last soldier?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">I ever am, dear Sir,</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c2">Most affectionately yours,</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Adam

worried about finding enough events in the French Revolution that pertained to Smith’s ideas that I could write about.  Since Smith focused so heavily on the economy, and economy took a </span><span class="c2">secondary</span><span class="c2"> role to ideas about government during the Revolution, I thought this would be very hard.  At first it was, but as I read more of </span><span class="c1">The Wealth of Nations</span><span class="c4 c2">, I found that Smith also had many ideas on other things, like some ideas on the limitation of government and the role of the military.  Nevertheless, I asked Pacy to write her letter first, thereby allowing me to support or refute some of her ideas rather that bringing up new ideas that might have little to do with what Smith was interested in.  I found it much easier to take on Smith’s interests in responding, because it was easy to disagree with something Pacy had Hume say by explaining the economics, or something else Smith was interested in, behind it.  My first letter I feel is a bit disorganized, but I left it like that because that’s how a handwritten letter likely would have been, especially if it was rushed.  In the latter letters, we developed ongoing arguments about whether economy or government should come first and whether the Constitution of 1793 held any disturbing implications, as well as a bunch of other disputes on other topics that were more quickly quelled.  Overall, I felt like our discussion got better in the later letters.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">When I first chose Adam Smith as my philosophe, I barely knew who he was.  By the time we had the Salon, I knew significantly more, but this was limited to his main ideas about economy and some of his ideas about limited government.  But this project forced me to understand a lot more of Smith’s ideas at an extremely detailed level, because I had to comment on specific events in the French Revolution or respond to Pacy/Hume’s commentary.  There still is a lot that I don’t know in detail, for </span><span class="c1">The Wealth of Nations</span><span class="c2"> is extremely long (not to mention his other books, like </span><span class="c1">The Theory of Moral Sentiments</span><span class="c2">, which I barely even got into), but I have made a significant improvement in terms of detailed knowledge about Smith’s ideas, even to the point where I was able to extrapolate further ideas that Smith never actually said but based on his other ideas were likely conclusions for him to make when presented with the events of the French Revolution.  Through writing these extensive, highly detailed letters, I have also had to consult many primary sources to find the small things that Smith would either agree with or criticize, or use as evidence to refute Pacy/Hume’s ideas.  However, for some of the </span><span class="c1">Constitutions </span><span class="c2">and </span><span class="c1">Declarations</span><span class="c2">, I found it very hard to find a full transcript translated into English.  Some of them were truncated or entirely in French, so for one of them, I had to actually use Google Translate to translate the </span><span class="c1">Constitution of 1795</span><span class="c2"> from its original French text into English.  In addition, because </span><span class="c1">The Wealth of Nations</span><span class="c4 c2"> is too long to read the entire thing with not much time, I also consulted many secondary/tertiary sources that commented and summarized Smith’s ideas about different topics, but I made sure that they were mostly highly credible journal articles, or at least written by a historian, economist, or in a credible university or other credible website.  Also, the fact that Smith was dead or dying when these letters were written made it considerably more difficult, because all these new ideas espoused during the Revolution had little precedent in Smith’s writing.  But as I said before, having Pacy go first and write some very inspiring and intelligent letters made it substantially easier for me, because I could either build off of or refute her great ideas, instead of having to start from scratch.</span></p><p class="c6 c8"><span class="c2">I know this entire paper is extremely long, over 16,000 words, but we both used a

Nations</span><span class="c4 c2">, Smith gives extremely lengthy explanations for even very simple economic principles, and he often gives many long examples as well, and this made my letters very long, because I closely examined all of Pacy/Hume’s points and all the events that occurred in that time period that would have interested Smith at all and then extensively elaborated upon almost all of them, especially in respect to the points of Pacy/Hume that I disagreed with.  At the end, we also included two very short letters satirizing Smith’s letter lamenting the death of David Hume based on the supposition that Hume had faked his death, and that was how he was still writing letters about the French Revolution.  Also, we decided to only do annotated works cited instead of annotated bibliographies, for reasons I explained more at the top of my annotated works cited.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c6 c8 c11"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c22 c14"><span class="c15 c2">Reflection: Pacy Yan</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">        This project, overall, was very enlightening on several levels. When I began this project, I speculated on whether or not the entirety of it would be me (Hume) going on tangents about the greatness of decreasing religious influence and condemning those Royalists. I understood, to a much smaller extent than now, a general basis for the views of Hume surrounding politics but what he was most famous for were his skeptical ideas about religion. This gave me a headache, especially when I read more into the literature and discovered that there are many different interpretations of his work. Some scholars say, for example, he favored a constitutional monarchy and others say he was an absolutist by default. And, still, there are those that say he was a radical Whig (in one of the sources) that only admired absolutism. Also confusing were his ideas on women. He used language that suggested subordination, but the essay I read suggested that correlation with subordination did not believe he thought thus about their capacity. So, in writing these letters, I had to take several standpoints.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">        When I began the first letter, I looked into the events that happened during the time period that was specified in the original assignment and found radical ideas. I found things that, I believe, Hume would have found worth criticism. Throughout most letters, I maintained an idea of Hume being pro-Constitutional monarchy or absolute monarchy. Underlying themes I found in a lot of Hume’s works were moderation, a scientific and logical approach (that viewed actions as a series of causes and effects), and religious condemnation (actually, I even read a paper of sorts suggesting the opposite.) In writing the letters, I tried to express these themes, whether he was lamenting on the political disorganization and radicalism in France or viciously attacking the rights of the church. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">        I realized a lot of things about Hume. In reading both primary and secondary sources concerning his works, I got to understand a lot of what he implied. To take up his voice was difficult but it gave me crucial knowledge and the project itself had me actually think in terms of what Hume would say.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">        Rather than my original fear that this project would become repetitive, I realize there is generally more to say about a subject, especially through discussion, than there appears at first. Not only did I get to understand that philosophes were not just a series of bullet-pointed ideas that I reference to when studying for a test or preparing a debate case with their words as warranted evidence, I got to understand Hume’s perspective and relationships with actual people (Adam Smith). Working with Khyber/Adam actually helped me a lot more than I initially expected. (Not because I doubted Khyber but because I knew next to nothing about Hume’s views on economy during the Salon and all I knew about Adam Smith was “basically lots of capitalism”.) Nevertheless, when Khyber mentioned that these two Scottish philosophers had actual conversation with each other, I was interested. Working with a capitalist philosopher made me look deeper into Hume’s views on the economy. At one point, I was also researching what Adam Smith’s religious views were (there are theories that he went to college to become a religious figure. How disappointed would Hume be if he knew) and towards the last couple of letters I referenced to Khyber/Smith questionable religious identity in a joking way. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">        While I tried to make Hume’s ideas as general and irrefutable as possible, but I took a couple views into consideration. I bought Don Garrett’s point about women’s capacity and I included that in the essay. I also sided with the ideas of Hume being a conservative with theories about origin and moderation despite having a source that saw him as a Whig. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c4 c2">        Working with Khyber also helped me a lot, despite his consistent insistence that the economy has to be looked to before the government and refusal to agree that giving people the right to rebel is disturbing. Because his letters were so long, it was overwhelming to respond to all of it. But what it did was force me to have to go back and warrant my arguments, read deeper and learn more about Hume’s ideas. Often, I didn’t respond to his refutations on my points in efforts to talk about new things as the revolution progressed with each time period. </span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">        All in all, I thought this project was both very interesting and satisfying in terms of how much you gain from it. Our paper is pretty long, but that is credited to the length of the work cited pages and the long arguments the two philosophers got into. As the letters progressed, our arguments became better phrased and understood and we could read each other’s work in a more clarified way that made us think more. </span></p></div><div id="footer"><span>Published by <a target="_blank" title="Learn more about Google Drive" href="//docs.google.com/">Google Drive</a></span><span class="dash">&ndash;</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/abuse?id=AKkXjoyvUqrWtIOOjcwRKe1WsX6YvIf1UjMVwACEDQkK6dE4Eh2khqVsGreIuGJbkqjJlXCrmwJ2HCLfqsf_swM:0">Report Abuse</a><span class="dash">&ndash;</span><span>Updated automatically every 5 minutes</span></div><script type="text/javascript">(function(){var aa="function"==typeof Object.create?Object.create:function(a){function b(){}b.prototype=a;return new b},ba;if("function"==typeof Object.setPrototypeOf)ba=Object.setPrototypeOf;else{var ca;a:{var da={s:!0},ea={};try{ea.__proto__=da;ca=ea.s;break a}catch(a){}ca=!1}ba=ca?function(a,b){a.__proto__=b;if(a.__proto__!==b)throw new TypeError(a+" is not extensible");return a}:null}var fa=ba;
